<h2>FERNLEY HOUSE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A DUET</h3>


<p>"Well, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Not a word to throw at a dog, as Rosalind
says?"</p>

<p>"You are not a dog, Uncle John. Besides,
you know all about it without my saying a
word, so why should I be silly, and spoil your
comfortable cigar? Dear children! They will
have a delightful time, I hope; and of course it
is perfectly right that they should go to their
father when he wants them; and&mdash;the summer
will pass quickly."</p>

<p>"Very quickly!" Mr. Montfort assented,
watching his smoke rings float upward.</p>

<p>"And Peggy is coming; and&mdash;oh, we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be all right, of course we shall; only&mdash;we do
miss them, don't we, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"I should think we did! A house is a poor
place without children; and we flatter ourselves
that our two&mdash;eh, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are the dearest children in the
world," said Margaret with conviction. "There
is no possible doubt about that."</p>

<p>She sighed, and took up her work; Mr. Montfort
blew smoke rings and watched them melt
into the air. There was an interval of sympathetic
silence.</p>

<p>The children, Basil and Susan D., Margaret's
cousins, had hardly been gone two hours, yet the
time seemed already long to Margaret Montfort.
Fernley House, which only this morning had
been so running over with joy and sunlight, and
happy noise and bustle, seemed suddenly to have
become a great empty barrack, full of nothing
but silence. Margaret, after putting away, sadly
enough, the things that the children had left
about, had been glad to join her uncle on the
pleasant back verandah that overlooked the
garden.</p>

<p>Fernley was in the full glory of early summer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The leaves were still young, and too soft to
rustle in the gently moving air; the laburnums
and honey-locusts were in blossom, and the
bees came and went, heavy-laden. The sombre,
trailing branches of the great Norway spruces
touched the smooth green turf, starred here and
there with English daisies. Farther back, the
tulip-trees towered stately, and the elm branches
swept the crest of the tall box hedges.</p>

<p>Margaret's eyes kept wandering from her
work. How could she stitch, when things were
looking like this? There was the oriole, swinging
on the bough beside his nest, pouring out
his song, "Joy! joy! joy!" The eggs might
be hatched to-day. Basil had begged her to
promise that she would let neither cat nor
squirrel meddle with the young birds. What
should she do, if she saw a cat up there, forty
feet from the ground? Dear Basil! he never
could understand why she could not climb trees
as well as he and Susan D. Dear Basil! dearest
of boys! how nice he looked in his new blue
suit; and who would mend the first "barndoor"
that he tore in jacket or trousers?</p>

<p>And little Susan D.! the warm clasp of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her arms seemed still about Margaret's neck,
in that last strangling hug of parting. She
had grown so dear, the little silent child! "I
will be good," she whispered. "Cousin Margaret,
I will try not to die without you, and I
will remember the things you told me about
papa; but don't make me stay very long, because
I haven't got enough goodness to last very
long, you know I haven't."</p>

<p>Margaret was roused from her reverie by her
uncle's voice.</p>

<p>"When did you say Peggy was coming, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Next week, Uncle John. School closes on
the eighteenth. Dear little Peggy! think of
her being a senior! it seems hardly possible.
She is afraid I shall tell her to put her hair up;
I certainly shall not, at least while she is
here. I am sure you prefer the pigtail, don't
you, Uncle John?"</p>

<p>"Yes! oh, yes!" said Mr. Montfort, abstractedly.
"Pigtail&mdash;yes, by all means. And how
will you and Peggy amuse yourselves, my dear?
No Rita this summer to electrify us all. You
will not find it dull?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dull, Uncle John? how could Fernley possibly
be dull? Why, Peggy and I are going to
be as happy as possible. I have all kinds of
plans made. You see, it is time Peggy was
learning something about housekeeping and
that sort of thing, and I thought this summer
would be the very best time to show her a little.
Of course, when she is at home, she wants to be
doing twenty thousand things on the farm, just
as she always has done, and the time goes so
quickly, she has not begun to think yet about
the indoor things; so I am going to be the
Humdrum-major, Uncle, and give her some lessons;
if you approve, that is."</p>

<p>"Highly, my dear, highly. Every woman
should be able to take care of her own house,
and the only way for her to learn is to begin
upon some one else's. I should think Peggy
might make a vigorous little housekeeper, if
a chaotic one. Don't let her loose in the
library, Margaret, that is my only prayer."</p>

<p>"Uncle John, I really do believe that you
think housekeeping consists entirely in dusting
and setting things to wrongs, as you call it."</p>

<p>"Well, my love, I confess that has always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
seemed to me a prime element in the art. But
I also confess my ignorance, and the depth and
darkness thereof. Am I humble enough? Now
I must go and take the puppies for an airing.
Till dinner-time, May Margaret!"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort strolled away, and Margaret
bent with renewed energy over her work, giving
herself a little shake as she did so. Her uncle's
words still sounded in her ears: "You will not
find it dull?" She had answered out of the
fulness of her heart, thinking it impossible that
dulness should come where Uncle John was,
especially as he happened to be at Fernley
House, the most enchanting place in the world.
Yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;it was going to be very, very
different, of course, from the life of the past
year, so filled full and running over with delight.
It was not only that she missed the
children; it was that in the care of them, the
watching over the growing bodies and the eager
minds, she was learning so much herself, feeling
the world grow, almost hourly, bigger and
brighter and sweeter. The mother-nature was
strong in Margaret Montfort, and the children
were bringing out all that was best and strongest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in her. Well, she must do without that
now for awhile; and there was no doubt that
the prospect seemed a little flat, even with
Peggy to brighten it. Dear Peggy! Margaret
loved her fondly; but she was so grown up
now, so strong herself, so helpful and self-reliant,
that there was no question of taking care
of her any more. "Why, she knows twenty
times as much as I do," said Margaret, "about
most things, except history. I don't suppose
she will ever remember the difference between
Mary Stuart and Mary Tudor. But, foolish
creature," cried Margaret to herself, "what
have you just been saying to Uncle John?
Here is all the world of housekeeping, about
which Peggy knows little or nothing, and
which, thanks to Elizabeth and Frances, you
do begin to understand a little. Is it a small
thing, I ask you, to teach the qualities and fine
shades of damask, and the high-lights of huckaback?
or the different cuts of meat, and when
what is in season? I am ashamed of you, Margaret
Montfort! And then there are the puppies,
too! Don't let me hear another word of dulness
from you, miss, do you hear? Perhaps you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
would like to be weaving cotton in a factory
this heavenly day, or selling yards of hot stuffs
in a shop? Go away!" and Margaret shook
her head severely, and was surprised at herself.</p>

<p>The puppies were two fine young setters, Nip
and Tuck by name, which the wise uncle had
bought on purpose to soften the blow of the
parting with the children. Margaret had never
known dogs before, and though Messrs. Nip and
Tuck were being strictly trained, and had to
spend much of their time in the stable-yard,
she still had many a pleasant half-hour with
them, when her uncle took them for a run over
hill and dale, or gave them a lesson in the garden.
Her one anxiety was lest they should
meet the Queen of Sheba, her great Angora cat,
and there should be trouble; for the Queen was
a person of decided temper. Margaret had
taken infinite pains, ever since the arrival of
the puppies, to keep them out of one another's
sight; but Mr. Montfort warned her that she
was merely putting off the inevitable, and that
the day must come when cat and dogs should
meet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed a little hard that this meeting must
take place when the master was not present;
but the finger of Fate pointed, and at this very
moment, while Margaret was sitting with her
peaceful thoughts, Michael, the stable-boy,
chanced to drop the leash in which he was leading
the puppies to their master. Three minutes
later, Nip and Tuck were careering wildly
around Margaret, leaping on her with frantic
caresses, and talking both at once, and very
loud, as dear dogs will sometimes do.</p>

<p>"Down, Nip!" cried Margaret. "Tucky,
do behave yourself. Now, boys, however did
you get away? Charge, do, like dear boys, and
wait for the master; he will be here in a minute."</p>

<p>Nip and Tuck explained breathlessly that
they had just got out by the luckiest chance in
the world, that they loved her to distraction,
and that, upon the whole, they preferred her
society to that of any one else in the world, if
only she would let them lick her nose. This
Margaret firmly refused to do, and they lay
down panting for a moment, but only for a
moment. Again the finger of Fate pointed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and so it came to pass that as Mr. Montfort
came round one corner in search of his run-aways,
the Queen of Sheba came round the
other. There seemed but one white flash as
the two puppies, recognizing their destiny on
the instant, flew to meet it, yelling like demons
of the pit.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John!" cried Margaret, starting
up in distress. "My poor Queen! my poor
Sheba! they will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry, Margaret," said Mr.
Montfort. "Sheba can take care of herself, if
I am not greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>The great cat stiffened herself into a bristling
bow, and waited the charge with gleaming
eyes. The dogs' frenzied rush carried them
within a foot of her whiskers, and there they
stopped. This was not what they had looked
for. They had seen cats before, and had chased
them, with infinite joy; their mother had
taught them that cats were made to be chased,
with a special eye to the healthful amusement
of good little dogs. But this furry, glaring
creature, radiating power and menace,&mdash;could
this be a cat?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Nip and Tuck put their heads on one side
and considered. The Queen of Sheba advanced
one step, slowly; the puppies retired, too, and
sat down, wagging their tails. Perhaps, after
all, it was a kind of dog; their minds were
cheerfully open to new impressions, and they
were full of good will toward all creation.
Perceiving their innocence, the Queen of Sheba,
who had seen many generations of puppies,
lowered her warlike arch, and, sitting down
opposite them, proceeded to wash herself elaborately.
Nip and Tuck looked on with open-mouthed
admiration. Presently Tuck, who was
a bold dog, gave a short bark of decision, and,
stepping forward, began with infinite politeness
to assist in the washing. Sheba received the
attention with regal condescension. Five minutes
later, all three walked off together, rubbing
sides cordially, and presumably in quest of
rats.</p>

<p>Margaret drew a long breath. "Did you ever
see anything like that?" she cried. "Look,
Uncle John; they are talking to one another;
you can almost hear the words. Isn't it wonderful?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very pretty," said Mr. Montfort. "Now
they'll be friends for life, you'll see. Sheba
will be of great assistance in their education.
It takes an intelligent cat to understand puppies,
and Sheba is a remarkably intelligent cat.
Well, May Margaret, and now shall we take
our four-legged children for a walk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John, I was so afraid you were
not going to ask me! Will you wait just half
a minute while I get my hat? and on the way
back I will stop and see Mrs. Peyton. I have
not been there since the dogs came or the children
went, and I ought to be ashamed."</p>

<p>Margaret ran up-stairs lightly, saying to herself
as she ran, "Dull, with that man? and
Peggy and the puppies beside? Margaret Montfort,
I <i>am</i> ashamed of you!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>MRS. PEYTON'S COMPANION</h3>


<p>"Dear me!" said Mrs. Peyton. "Here is
Patience, down off her monument, come all
this way to smile at Grief! I am Grief, my
dear; allow me to introduce myself. Well,
Margaret, and how do you get on without
your brats&mdash;I beg pardon! I mean your
pets?"</p>

<p>"As well as could be expected," said Margaret,
lightly, as she stooped to kiss the ivory
forehead. Mrs. Peyton was charming, but one
did not confide one's troubles to her. "We are
behaving beautifully, Mrs. Peyton. Not only
have we dried our tears and hung our pocket-handkerchiefs
out to dry, but we have set up
some new pets already."</p>

<p>"Not more children? Not another set of 'The
Orphans of Fernley,' bound in blue denim? That
would be unendurable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; four-legged pets this time. We have
two dogs, Mrs. Peyton; beautiful Gordon setters.
I hope you are fond of dogs."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;dogs? Yes, I like dogs. As a rule I
like them better than two-legged torments. You
are a two-legged torment, Margaret, when you
move about the room in that exasperatingly light-footed
manner. I don't suppose you actually do
it to make me feel my helplessness, but it has
that effect. Do sit down! you are not a bird.
And don't, for pity's sake, look patient! If there
is one thing I cannot abide, it is to see people
look patient when I insult them. If I had only
known&mdash;but John Montfort always did like
to thwart me, it's his nature&mdash;if I had only
known, I say, that those brats of yours were
going away, I need not have set up a menagerie
of my own. It's too late now, the creature's
coming."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Peyton?" asked
Margaret, always prepared for any whim of her
whimsical neighbor. "Are you setting up a
dog too?"</p>

<p>"No! nothing half so comfortable as a dog.
A fox, or wolf, or hyena, or something of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
kind. Don't be stupid, Margaret; I am not up
to explanations to-day. A companion, simpleton!
A Miss Fox or Miss Wolfe, I can't remember
which. I don't <i>think</i> it was Miss Hyena,
but it might be. It's an unusual name, but she
is recommended as an unusual person."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peyton! you said you never would try
it again. And you know I am always ready to
come and read to you."</p>

<p>"I know you are a little Fra Angelico angel,
with your halo laid in your top bureau drawer
among your collars, for fear people should see
it; but I have a little scrap of conscience about
me somewhere,&mdash;not much, only about a saltspoonful,&mdash;and
if you came every day it would
get up and worry me, and I can't be worried.
Besides, the doctor ordered it, positively."</p>

<p>"Doctor Flower? has he been out again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he came on Monday. I thought I was
going to die, and wanted him to see how prettily
I should do it. I'll never send for him again;
he always tells me to get up and do things.
Tiresome man! I told him I was perfectly exhausted
by simply listening to him for half an
hour. He replied by ordering this Miss Fox, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whoever she is. I am to try her for a month;
I sha'n't probably keep her a week."</p>

<p>"A nurse?"</p>

<p>"No, not a trained nurse. She means to be
one, goes to the hospital in the autumn. He
thinks she has a gift, or something. I detest
people with a gift. Probably she has a squint,
too. You will have to receive her when she
comes, Margaret, and take the edge off her. I
fancy her unendurable, but I promised to try;
I really must be going to die, I am growing so
amiable. Which of my gems do you want? I
am going to make my will this time. You
needn't laugh, Margaret Montfort."</p>

<p>"I was laughing at your dying of amiability,
Mrs. Peyton!" said Margaret. "When is this
young lady&mdash;I suppose she is young, if she is
going to study nursing&mdash;when is she coming?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, I believe; or is it to-day?
where is the note? Tuesday! Is this Tuesday?
It cannot be."</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Tuesday, and the three o'clock
train&mdash;I suppose that is the train she will come
by&mdash;must be in by this time. Hark! there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wheels this moment. Can she be coming now,
Mrs. Peyton?"</p>

<p>"My dear, it would be exactly like the conception
I have formed of her. Go down and
see her, will you, Margaret? Tell her I have a
headache, or Asiatic cholera, or anything you
like. I cannot possibly see her to-day. Her
name is Fox&mdash;or Wolfe, I can't remember
which. Bless you, child! you save my life.
Show her the Calico Room. Hand me the amethyst
rope before you go; I must compose my
nerves."</p>

<p>With a smile and a sigh, Margaret ran down-stairs,
and met the newcomer on the doorstep.
A tall, pale, grave-looking girl, with deep-set
blue eyes, and smooth bands of brown hair&mdash;a
rather remarkable-looking person, Margaret
thought.</p>

<p>"Miss Fox?" she said, hurriedly, holding out
her hand. "Oh, how do you do? Pray come
in. Mrs. Peyton asked me to receive you,&mdash;I
am a friend and neighbor,&mdash;and show you your
room and make you comfortable. She has a
bad headache, and does not feel able to welcome
you herself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>She led the way into the dining-room, and
rang the bell. "You will have lunch?" she
said, "or would you rather have tea?"</p>

<p>"Tea, please," said the stranger; and her
voice had a deep, musical note, that fell pleasantly
on Margaret's ear.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Mrs. Peyton is unable to see me.
Is it a real headache, or doesn't she want
to?"</p>

<p>Margaret colored and hesitated. The blue
eyes looked straight into hers with a compelling
gaze; a gleam of comprehension seemed to lurk
in their depths. Margaret was absolutely truthful,
and, consequently, was sometimes at a loss
when speaking of her invalid friend.</p>

<p>"Doctor Flower told me somewhat about
her," Miss Fox went on. "He thinks&mdash;he
wants me to rouse her to effort."</p>

<p>She spoke so quietly, her whole air was one
of such calm and repose, that Margaret looked
at her wonderingly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/gs02.png" width="274" height="400" alt="&quot;MARGARET DID THE HONORS, STILL FEELING VERY SHY.&quot;" title="&quot;MARGARET DID THE HONORS, STILL FEELING VERY SHY.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MARGARET DID THE HONORS, STILL FEELING VERY SHY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"If Doctor Flower has explained the case to
you," she said, at last, "you probably know
more about it than I do. Mrs. Peyton often
seems to suffer a great deal. She is fanciful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
too, no doubt, at times; I suppose most invalids are."</p>

<p>"I have just been staying with a woman who
had had both feet cut off by a train," said Miss
Fox, tranquilly. "She was not fanciful."</p>

<p>It was a relief when the tea came. Margaret
did the honors, still feeling very shy, she could
not tell why, before this grave person, who
could not be more than a year or two older
than herself.</p>

<p>"Have you come far to-day, Miss Fox?" she
asked, for the sake of saying something. The
stranger put her head on one side, and gave her
a quaint look. "Any addition to one's personal
menagerie is always interesting," she said; "but
one has one's favorites in the Zoo. If it is not
taking a liberty&mdash;why Fox?"</p>

<p>Margaret started, and blushed violently. "I
<i>beg</i> your pardon," she said. "Mrs. Peyton was
not sure&mdash;she could not remember&mdash;is it Miss
Wolfe, then? I hope you will forgive me, Miss
Wolfe!"</p>

<p>"Please don't," said Miss Wolfe. She smiled
for the first time, and Margaret thought she
had never seen so sweet a smile. "It is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
your fault that I am philologically quadruped,
surely. So long as I am not called Zebra, I
really don't mind. I always associate Zebra
with Zany, don't you know? they were in my
Alphabet together. But you were saying something
which I was rude enough to interrupt."</p>

<p>"I only asked if you had come far."</p>

<p>"Not very far, if you put it in miles; only
from New York; if you mean by impressions, a
thousand leagues. It is at least that from that
maelstrom to this quiet green place. How
should one have nerves in a place like this?
To sit here in peace and turn slowly into a
lettuce&mdash;that would be the natural thing; but
life is not natural, if you have observed."</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. "Mrs. Peyton is certainly
not in the least like a lettuce; I don't know
whether you see any signs of the change in me;
I have only been here two years, though."</p>

<p>Miss Wolfe surveyed her critically. "N&mdash;no!"
she said, slowly. "I see nothing indicating
lettuce&mdash;as yet. You are cool and green&mdash;no
offence, I hope! I pay you one of the
highest compliments I know of when I call you
green; it is the color of rest and harmony;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
cool and green enough, and pleasantly wavy in
your lines, but you have too much expression as
yet, far too much. Placidity&mdash;absence of emotion&mdash;that
is what superinduces the lettuce
habit." She waved her hand gracefully, and
seemed to fall into a reverie. Margaret surveyed
her in growing wonder.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Peyton's bell rang
violently; and presently a maid appeared to
say that her mistress was feeling better, and
would see the lady now. Miss Wolfe rose and
glanced significantly at Margaret. "Curiosity
overcomes distaste!" she said. "Are you
coming?"</p>

<p>"No," said Margaret. "I think I'd better
not. I will slip away quietly. But I shall see
you soon again. I will run over this evening,
perhaps; and you must come over to Fernley
whenever Mrs. Peyton can spare you. It is
very near, just across the park."</p>

<p>"Fernley!" repeated Miss Wolfe, pausing
and looking at Margaret with an altered expression.</p>

<p>"Fernley House, Mr. Montfort's place. That
is where I live. Why&mdash;I have never introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
myself all this time, have I? I am Mr.
Montfort's niece; my name is Montfort, too,
Margaret Montfort."</p>

<p>"Oh, my prophetic soul! my aunt!" exclaimed
Miss Wolfe. "I beg your pardon;
nothing of the sort. I am somewhat mad at
times. Good morning, Miss Montfort; I am
glad to know you. To be continued in our
next!"</p>

<p>She nodded, kissed her hand gravely to
Margaret, and turning, followed the maid up-stairs.</p>

<p>Margaret looked after her for a moment in
amazement. "What a <i>very</i> extraordinary girl!"
she said. "She seemed to know my name. I
wonder how."</p>

<p>She paused, shook her head, then went soberly
home across the park, wondering how the new
venture would turn out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>AN ARRIVAL</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="279" height="400" alt="&quot;AT THIS MOMENT POLLY APPEARED RED-CHEEKED AND BREATHLESS.&quot;" title="&quot;AT THIS MOMENT POLLY APPEARED RED-CHEEKED AND BREATHLESS.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AT THIS MOMENT POLLY APPEARED RED-CHEEKED AND BREATHLESS.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"What can the dogs be barking at, Elizabeth?"
asked Margaret, looking up from the
table-cloth she was examining. "I'm afraid
they have got a squirrel again."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard the sound of wheels,
Miss," said the sedate Elizabeth, who had just
entered, her arms full of shining damask.
"Just as I was coming up the stairs, Miss
Margaret. I told Polly run and see who it
was, and send 'em away if they was a tramp.
It do be mostly tramps, these days; Frances
says she'll poison the next one, Miss, but she
always feeds 'em so as they go off and send all
their friends."</p>

<p>At this moment Polly appeared, red-cheeked
and breathless. A gentleman was below, asking
for Mr. Montfort, and she couldn't find Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Montfort nowhere in the house; so then he said
could he see Miss Margaret?</p>

<p>"Is it any one I know, Polly?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Marget; I niver see
him. A lame gentleman with a crutch; he
looks just lovely!" added Polly, with effusion.</p>

<p>"Miss Margaret didn't ask you how he looked,
Polly!" said Elizabeth, severely. "You let
your tongue run away with you."</p>

<p>"Tell him I will be down directly, Polly,"
said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Margaret, do you think you'd
better?" asked Elizabeth. "If it's not a
tramp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed, and he's no tramp!" broke in Polly,
indignantly. "He's a gentleman, if ever I see
one, Miss Margaret; and him in lovely white
clothes and all, just like young Mr. Pennyfeather
as was here last year."</p>

<p>"Polly, will you learn to speak when you are
spoken to, and not interrupt your elders?" demanded
Elizabeth. "If he's not a tramp, I
was saying, Miss Margaret, he's likely an agent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of some kind, and why should you be annoyed,
with all the linen to go over? He can call
again, most likely."</p>

<p>Elizabeth spoke with some feeling under her
grave and restrained words. The examination
of the house-linen was to her mind the most
important event of the week, and already they
had been disturbed once by a sudden incursion
of the dogs, bringing a dead squirrel.</p>

<p>"No, Elizabeth," said Margaret, "I must go
down. Tell the gentleman I will be down directly,
Polly; show him into the library, please.
Dear Elizabeth, you can finish the table-cloths
just as well without me. You always did it
before I came."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Miss," said Elizabeth, with
patient resignation; "you'll find me in the
sewing-room, Miss, whenever you are ready for
me. It's best that you should go over the
things yourself, and then you will be satisfied,
and no mistakes made."</p>

<p>Margaret nodded, with a little inward sigh
over the rigidity of Elizabeth's ideal of a perfect
housekeeper; patted her hair hurriedly to make
sure that it was neat, confirmed the pat by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
glance in the mirror, and went quickly down-stairs.</p>

<p>A tall, slender figure rose, leaning on a stick,
as she entered the library. "What a sad face!"
was Margaret's first thought; but, when the
stranger smiled, it changed to "What a beautiful
one!"</p>

<p>"Cousin Margaret?" said the young man,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am Margaret," said the girl. "But
who&mdash;oh! are you&mdash;can it be Peggy's Hugh?
It is, I see. Oh, how do you do, Cousin? I am
so very, very glad to see you."</p>

<p>They shook hands cordially, scanning each
other with earnest and friendly eyes.</p>

<p>"I should have known you, of course, from
your picture, if not from Peggy's ardent descriptions,"
said Hugh Montfort.</p>

<p>"And I ought to have known you, surely,"
cried Margaret; "only, not knowing you were
in this part of the country, you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle John did not get my letter? It
ought to have reached him some days ago. I
was coming on to Cambridge, and wrote as soon
as I started. No wonder you were surprised,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
being hailed as cousin by an unheralded vagabond
with a stick."</p>

<p>"Oh, why do you stand?" cried Margaret.
"Sit down, Cousin Hugh; to think of its being
really you; I have wanted to see and know you
ever since&mdash;oh, for ever so long. Hark! there
comes Uncle John now. How delighted he
will be!"</p>

<p>"Margaret, my dear!" called Mr. Montfort
from the hall. "I have just had a letter&mdash;most
surprising thing&mdash;from&mdash;hallo! what's
all this? Hugh, my dear fellow, I'm delighted
to see you. Got here before your letter, eh?
How did that happen? Never mind, so long
as you are here now. Well, well, well! sit
down here, and let me look at you. This is a
pleasure indeed. Your father's eyes; I should
know them in a Chinaman; not that you look
like a Chinaman. How are they all at home?
How's your father? When did you leave
home? Have you had anything to eat? What
would you like? Margaret, my dear, get Hugh
something to eat, he's probably starved."</p>

<p>Hugh laughingly disclaimed starvation, and
begged to wait till their tea-time. "I am not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hungry, truly I am not," he said. "There is
so much to say, too, isn't there, Uncle John?
Father is very well and hearty. I have a pipe
for you in my bag. I brought a bag with me;
do you suppose you could put me up for a few
days, Uncle?"</p>

<p>Reassured by Mr. Montfort's earnest assurance
that he should keep him all summer, Hugh
leaned back in his chair, and looked about him
with eager eyes.</p>

<p>"This is the library!" he said. "Uncle John,
ever since I learned to read, one of my dreams
has been to see this room. Father has always
told us about it, and where his favorite books
were, and where you all used to sit when you
came here to read."</p>

<p>He rose and, crossing the room, took a book
from a shelf without a moment's hesitation.
"Here is the 'Morte d'Arthur,'" he said; "you
see I knew where to find it. And Father used
to sit on top of that stepladder."</p>

<p>"So he did!" cried Mr. Montfort, delighted.
"I can see him now, with one leg curled under
him, eating apples and shouting about Lancelot
and Tristram."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you sat in the great copper coal-hod&mdash;ah!
there it is!&mdash;and read Froissart, the great
folio with the colored prints. I see it, just in the
place father described."</p>

<p>"Uncle John," said Margaret, reproachfully,
"you never told me that you sat in the coal-scuttle.
I know papa's perch, the mantel-piece,
because he could get at the little Shakespeares
from there."</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort laughed.</p>

<p>"Leave me some remnant of dignity, Meg,"
he said. "How can you expect me to confess
that I sat in the coal-scuttle? Have you no reverence
for gray hairs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a very great deal, dear Uncle; but there
were no gray hairs in the coal-scuttle days; and
my only regret about you is the not having
known you when you were a boy."</p>

<p>"Horrid monkey, I have been given to understand,"
said her uncle, lightly. "Go on, Hugh;
tell us some more of the things that Jim&mdash;your
father&mdash;remembers. Old Jim! it's a great
shame that he never comes to look up the old
place himself."</p>

<p>"It is indeed, sir!" said Hugh. "I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
always thought so, and now that I see the place&mdash;oh,
I shall send him, that's all, as soon as
ever I get home. There are the Indian clubs;
oh, the carved one&mdash;is it true that that was
given to Grandfather Montfort by a Fiji chief,
or was the Pater fooling us? He sometimes
makes up things, he acknowledges, just for the
fun of it."</p>

<p>"True enough, I believe!" said Mr. Montfort,
taking down the great club, covered from end
to end with strange and delicate carving.</p>

<p>"Did he ever tell you how near he came to
breaking my head with this club? He may have
forgotten; I have not. We used to keep it in
our room, the great nursery up-stairs, Margaret;
you must show that to Hugh by and by. I
woke up one night, and was afraid the crow that
I was taming in the back garden might be
hungry. I got out of the window and shinned
down the spout. The crow was all right; but
when I came back, Jim woke up, and took me
for a burglar, and went for me with the club,
thinking it the chance of his life. I was only
half-way through the bars when he caught me a
crack&mdash;I can hear my skull rattle with it now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John! and you held on?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I held on; it would have been
rather unfortunate for me to let go at the
moment. I sung out, of course; and when I got
through I fell upon my friend James, and Roger
had to wake up and come and drag us from
under the bed before he could separate us.
Sweet boys! do you and your brothers indulge
in these little endearments, Hugh? Jim was a
glorious fighter."</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. "Jim and George used to
have pretty lively scraps sometimes," he said.
"It wasn't so much in my line, but I took it out
in airs, I fancy. The poor fellows couldn't
punch my head, and it must have been hard
lines for them sometimes. As for Max and
Peter, they are twins, you know. I doubt if
either of them knows exactly which is himself
and which is the other, so they don't have real
scraps, just puppy-play, rolling over and over
and pounding each other."</p>

<p>"Oh, what good times they would have with
Basil and Susan D.!" cried Margaret. "What
a pity they cannot know one another, all these
dear boys!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it is! so it is!" said Mr. Montfort,
heartily. "We must bring it about, one of
these days; we must surely bring it about.
Fond of dogs, Hugh? I've got a pair of nice
puppies here; like to go and see them before
tea, or shall Margaret show you your room?"</p>

<p>Hugh elected in favor of the puppies, and
uncle and nephew walked off together, well
content. Margaret looked after them, thinking
what a noble pair they made. Hugh walked
lame, to be sure, yet not ungracefully, she
thought; and though slender, still his shoulders
were square and manly.</p>

<p>Then her thoughts turned to matters of practical
hospitality, and she sped to the kitchen,
to tell the good news to Frances.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frances, Mr. Hugh has come, my Uncle
Jim's son; Miss Peggy's brother, Frances! He
has come all the way from Ohio, and I want
you to give him the very best supper that ever
was, please!"</p>

<p>Now Frances had that moment discovered
that her best porcelain saucepan was cracked;
she therefore answered with some asperity.
"Indeed, then, Miss Margaret, what is good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
enough for Mr. Montfort must be good enough
for his nephew or any other young gentleman.
My supper is all planned, and I can't be fashed
with new things at this time of day."</p>

<p>"Now, Frances, don't be cross, that's a dear!
I want you to see Mr. Hugh. Look, there he is
this minute, crossing the green with Uncle John."</p>

<p>Frances looked; looked again, long and earnestly;
then straightway she fell into a great
bustle. "Dear me, Miss Margaret, run away
now, that's a good young lady. How can I be
doing, and you all about the kitchen like a ball
of string? He's lame, the beautiful young
gentleman; you never told me he was lame. I
did think as how we might be doing with the
cold fowl, and French fried potatoes and muffins,
but that's nothing to show the heart. Run
away now, Miss, and if you was going up-stairs,
be so good as send me Polly. She's idling her
time away, I'll be bound, and not a soul to
help me with my salad and croquettes. Dear!
dear! I be pestered out of my life, mostly."</p>

<p>"Don't kill us, Frances!" cried Margaret, as
she ran away, laughing. "I really think the
cold fowl will be quite enough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Frances deigned no reply; and Margaret
hastened up-stairs, to tell the good news to
Elizabeth. Elizabeth was in the sewing-room,
waiting, with plaintive dignity, till Margaret
should please to go over the rest of the table-cloths;
but at the tidings of the advent of a
dear and honored guest, she dropped thimble
and scissors, and rose hastily, declaring that the
Blue Room must be cleaned instantly, and put
in order for Mr. Montfort's nephew.</p>

<p>"But you swept it yesterday, Elizabeth, and
I dusted all the ornaments myself, and put
them back in place. It only needs a few fresh
flowers, I am sure," said Margaret.</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned on her a face of affectionate
reproach. "Miss Margaret, you don't mean
that. Mr. Montfort's own nephew, and the
room not touched to-day! I'll go this minute
and see to it. But if you would pick out the
towels you think he would like best, Miss,
please; gentlemen do be that fussy about
towels, as there's no pleasing some of them,
though being Mr. Montfort's nephew, likely he'll
be different. Give him the finest huckaback,
and Mr. Montfort is easy satisfied, so long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there's no fringes. He never could abide fringe
to his towels, and there's no person with sense
as wouldn't agree with him. And if you
would see to the bureau-scarf and the flowers,
Miss Margaret&mdash;there! she's gone, and not a
word about what table-napkins I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'be'">am</ins> to use! I
like to see them young, so I do, but they're
terrible heedless. I expect I'd best put the
finest out, for Mr. Montfort's nephew."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>UNCLE JOHN'S IDEA</h3>


<p>"Margaret, I have an idea!"</p>

<p>"I am so glad, Uncle John; your ideas are
always pleasant ones, especially when they
make your eyes twinkle. Is this about more
dogs?"</p>

<p>"No, no, child. Do you think I have no
soul except for dogs? I was thinking&mdash;why,
you see,&mdash;this is a delightful fellow, this nephew
of mine."</p>

<p>"Isn't he, Uncle? I never saw a more interesting
person, I think. How well he talks, and
how much he knows!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and right-minded, too; singularly right-minded.
Jim has done well, certainly, by his
children, and is very fortunate in them. H'm!
yes. Who would have thought, thirty years
ago, that things would have turned out in this
way? Old Jim!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Montfort fell into a brown study,
and only roused himself after some time, to ask
Margaret what were her orders for the day.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle John! And you have never
told me your idea."</p>

<p>"Bless me! so I haven't. Age, my dear
child, age! Such a fine idea as it is, too.
Listen, then! as I was saying, Hugh Montfort
is a charming fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle John."</p>

<p>"And Peggy Montfort is a charming girl."</p>

<p>"Certainly she is. Dear Peggy!"</p>

<p>"We may not unreasonably infer, therefore,
that other members of the family may be charming
also. Now, my idea is this. Peggy is not
going home this summer; why would it not be
a good plan to send for her nearest sister&mdash;Jean,
isn't she?&mdash;to come here and meet her
brother and sister, and all have a good time
together? What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Uncle John! I say that you are the very
cleverest person in the world, as well as the
dearest."</p>

<p>"A little house-party, you see," Mr. Montfort
went on, beaming with pleasure at the delight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that shone in Margaret's face. "And&mdash;we
shall want another lad, it seems to me, possibly
two lads. Why not ask young Merryweather
and his brother for a couple of weeks? You
liked the young fellow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, Uncle John!" Margaret suddenly
became interested in tying up the Crimson
Rambler that was straying over the verandah-rail.
"Yes, indeed, I thought him very nice."</p>

<p>"And you like the idea? You don't think
it would make too much work, too much responsibility,
my dear little niece?"</p>

<p>Margaret was still busy with the rose, which
proved quite refractory, but it was clear that
she thought nothing of the sort. It would be
altogether delightful, she said; and as for care&mdash;why,
she had been longing for something to
take her mind off missing the children, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"And to see Jean, too!" she cried, suddenly
emerging from the rose-vine, with an unusual
flush on her delicate cheek, and her gray eyes
shining; "I have always wanted so to know
the other Peggypods, as you call them, Uncle
John; and now to have Hugh here, and Jean
coming&mdash;oh, Uncle John, you are <i>so</i> dear!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that is all right," said Uncle John;
"and I will go and telegraph to old Jim and
tell him to send the little girl along. Shall we
tell Peggy, or leave it for a surprise, eh? What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"The surprise, by all means; Peggy loves a
surprise, you know. Oh, how can I wait a
whole week to see her?"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort looked with pleasure at Margaret's
sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks. He
had hit on the right thing, evidently. Young
people wanted young people; didn't he remember
well enough&mdash;here he fell into a muse
again, and said "Rose!" to himself two or
three times. Perhaps he was thinking of the
Crimson Rambler.</p>

<p>"Now, about rooms!" he said, waking up
after a few minutes. "And we must get more
help, Margaret. Frances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell Elizabeth first, I think," said Margaret,
thoughtfully. "She has a way of breaking things
gradually to Frances, and taking the
edge off them; she is really very clever about
it."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth is a treasure," said Mr. Montfort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"So is Frances, of course, a treasure&mdash;only
with dragon attachment."</p>

<p>"And as for the room, Uncle John&mdash;let me
see! Peggy's own room is big enough for her
and Jean, and I am quite sure they would like
to be together. Then there are the two little
east rooms that are very pleasant&mdash;or we
could give the two Mr. Merryweathers the big
nursery."</p>

<p>"That's it!" said Mr. Montfort, decidedly.
"Boys like the nursery; it was made for boys.
Nothing breakable in it except the crockery,
and plenty of room for skylarking. Yes, my
dear, get the nursery ready for them&mdash;if they
come!" he added. "We are counting our
chickens in fine style, Margaret. Suppose we
find that Jean is in San Francisco and the
Merryweathers in Alaska."</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't be!" cried Margaret.
"They wouldn't have the heart to spoil our
party. I have read about house-parties all my
life, and to think that I am going to have one!
Why, it is a fairy tale, Uncle John."</p>

<p>"So it is, my dear; so it is. You are the
fairy princess, and I am the old magician&mdash;or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the bear, if you like better, that used to be a
prince when he was young."</p>

<p>"The king that used to be a bear would be
more like it," said Margaret, gaily. "How
about John Strong, Mr. Montfort?"</p>

<p>"John Strong was a useful fellow!" said her
uncle, gravely. "I had a regard for John; he
is getting lazy now, and rheumatic besides, and
he neglects his roses shamefully, but there are
still points about John. Bring me my old hat,
and the pruning-shears, and you shall see him
in the flesh, Miss Margaret."</p>

<p>Margaret enjoyed nothing more than what
she called a "rose-potter" with her uncle. He
was never weary of tending his favorite flowers,
and handled and spoke of them as if they were
real persons. Coming now to join him, with
the great shears, and the faithful old straw hat
in which, as John Strong the gardener, she had
first seen the beloved uncle, she found him
bending over a beautiful "La France" with
anxious looks.</p>

<p>"My dear, this lovely person is not looking
well to-day. Something is wrong with her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, I am sorry. She had her bath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
last night, I know, for I gave it to her myself.
What do you think is the matter? To me, she
looks as silvery-lovely as usual; but you have a
special pair of eyes, I know, for roses."</p>

<p>"I fear&mdash;I think&mdash;ah! here he is, the
beast! Yes, Margaret; a caterpillar, curled
up&mdash;see him! Right in the heart of this
exquisite bud. No wonder the whole plant
has sickened; she is very sensitive, La France.
There, Madame, he is gone. Now, a little
shower of quassia, just to freshen you up; eh?
See, Margaret, how gratefully the beautiful creature
responds. Now, Jack here,"&mdash;he passed
on to a Jacqueminot rose, covered with splendid
crimson blossoms,&mdash;"Jack is thick-skinned,
quite a rhinoceros by contrast with La France
or the Bride. Here are&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;five&mdash;my
patience! here are seven aphides on his
poor leaves, and yet he has not curled up so
much as the edge of one. Take him for all in
all, Jack is as good a fellow as I know. Responsive,
cordial, ready for anything&mdash;not
expecting to have the whole world waiting on
him, as some of these people do&mdash;ah, Hugh!
Finished your letters? That's right!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh Montfort, who had come in unobserved,
was leaning on his stick, watching them with
some amusement.</p>

<p>"Who is this Jack, if I may ask, Uncle John?
He seems to be a rather remarkable sort of
chap."</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort looked slightly confused.
"Only my fantastic way of speaking of my
roses," he said. "They seem like real people
to me, and I am apt to call them by their
names. A shame, to be sure, to take such
liberties with the General. Permit me to present
you in due form! M. le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Jacqueminot,
I have the honor to present to you Mr.
Hugh Montfort, my nephew, and&mdash;may I say
admirer? The General is sensitive to admiration."</p>

<p>"You may indeed!" said Hugh, bowing
gravely to the splendid plant. "General, your
most obedient servant! I have known others
of your family, some of them, I may say, intimately,
and I can truly say that I never saw a
finer specimen of the race."</p>

<p>The General glowed responsive, and Mr. Montfort
glowed too, with pleasure. "Fond of roses?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
he said; "that's good! that's good! why, boy,
you seem to have a great many of my tastes.
How's that, hey? your father never knew one
flower from another."</p>

<p>There was a very tender light in Hugh's eyes
as he returned his uncle's look. "When I was
a little chap, sir," he said, "my father used to
tell me a good deal about you and Uncle
Roger, the two best fellows he ever knew. I
used to think&mdash;and I think still&mdash;that if
I could be like them in anything I should do
well; so I took to flowers because you loved
them, and to books because they were Uncle
Roger's delight. The big things seemed pretty
big, but I thought the little ones would be better
than nothing."</p>

<p>The glow deepened on John Montfort's cheek,
and the light in his eyes; in Margaret's eyes
the quick tears sprang; and with one impulse
she and her uncle held out their hands. Hugh
grasped them both, and there was a moment of
silence that was better than speech. Hugh was
the first to break it. "I have two new friends!"
he said, in his sweet, cordial voice. "This day
is better than I dreamed, and that is saying a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
good deal. But now, go on with the roses,
Uncle John, please; there are several kinds
here that I do not know. What is this cream-colored
beauty?"</p>

<p>"Why, that, Hugh, is my special pride. That
is a sport of my own raising; Victoria, I call
her. She took a first prize at the flower
show last year. We were proud, weren't we,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we were, Uncle John. Think, Hugh,
she had two hundred and seven buds and blossoms
when we sent her. She looked like a
snow-drift at sunrise; didn't you, Victoria?"</p>

<p>"Could you send a plant of this size without
injury? Ah! I see; pot sunk. Well, she is a
marvel of beauty, certainly. I have some slips
coming from home for you, Uncle; the box
ought to be here to-day or to-morrow. There
are one or two things that I think you may not
have. But you have a noble collection; what a
joy a rose-garden is!"</p>

<p>"Mine used to be the greatest pleasure I
had," said Mr. Montfort, "until I took to cultivating
another kind of flower, the human variety."
He pinched Margaret's ear affectionately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and she returned the pinch with a confidential
pat on his arm.</p>

<p>"For many years," he continued, "I lived
something of a hermit life, Hugh. There were
reasons&mdash;no matter now&mdash;at all events I preferred
solitude, and save for my good aunt,
your great-aunt Faith, about whom Margaret
will have a great deal to tell you, I saw practically
no one from year's end to year's end.
Very foolish, as I am now aware; criminally
foolish. I have got beyond all that, thank
Heaven! During this secluded period, my garden,
and my roses in particular, were my chief
resource, next to my books. Indeed, in summer
time the books had to take the second place, and
it should be so. You remember Bacon, Hugh:
'God Almighty first planted a garden; it is the
purest of human pleasures,' etc. I used to
know that essay by heart. In summer time, the
Great Book, sir, the Book of Nature, is opened
for us, spread open by a divine hand; it were
thankless as well as stupid to refuse to study it.
So I studied my garden first, and after that, my
fields and woods and pastures. Great reading
in a broken pasture! When I wanted human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
companionship&mdash;apart from that sweet and
gracious influence of her who was my second
mother&mdash;I found it in my friends between the
covers, who were always ready to talk or be
silent, as my mood inclined. I thought I did
well enough with Shakespeare and Montaigne
and the rest; I have learned now that one living
voice, speaking in love and kindness, is
worth them all for 'human nature's daily
food.'"</p>

<p>Margaret listened, wondering. Her uncle had
seldom said so much about his own life even to
her, his housemate and intimate companion these
two years; while Hugh, without a word, simply
from some power of silent sympathy that lay
in him, had drawn out this frank speech a
few hours after their first meeting. She wondered;
and then asked herself, why should she
wonder, since she herself felt the same drawing
toward her new-found relative. "This must be
what it is like to have a brother!" she said to
herself; and felt her heart quicken with a new
sense of comfort and happiness. "Such a
pleasant world!" said Margaret.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A VISION</h3>


<p>Hugh Montfort was having a delightful
morning. He had been at Fernley three days
now, and already knew every nook and corner
on the place. With his uncle's consent he had
appropriated for his own use the little summer-house,
covered with clematis and York and Lancaster
roses, that looked out over the south wall
of the garden, and away toward the sea. Here he
had brought his desk (an old one belonging to his
father, that Margaret had found in the garret),
and had tacked up a shelf for a few favorite
books; and here he was sitting, on the fairest
of June days, with a volume of Greek plays
open before him, considering the landscape, and
enjoying himself thoroughly.</p>

<p>Hugh was no less delighted with his uncle
and cousin than they with him. Always and
necessarily a student and observer rather than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
man of action, he felt an instant sympathy with
the man and woman of books and thought. He
loved dearly his own family, active, strenuous
people, overflowing with strength and energy;
but he often felt himself out of place among
them, and reproached himself with the frequent
languor and headache that so often kept him
from sharing in their full-throated, whole-hearted
mirth. He had graduated from a Western
university, and was now going to study for
a post-graduate degree at Harvard; he was
tired, and the quiet at Fernley, the sense of perfect
congeniality with his uncle, and Margaret's
serene face and musical, even-toned voice, were
like balm to his over-strung nerves.</p>

<p>This morning his head ached, and he did not
feel like study. The book open before him gave
him a kind of moral support, but he did hardly
more than glance at it from time to time. His
eyes roved far and wide over the lovely prospect
that lay outside, broad stretches of sunny, rolling
meadows, dotted with clumps of trees, and
framed in the arched opening of the summer-house.
This summer-house had been a favorite
playhouse of his father and uncles in their boyhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
He knew a dozen stories about it; and
now his eyes turned to the lattice walls, carved
everywhere with the familiar initials, and the
devices of the four brothers Montfort: John's
egg and Jim's oyster, Roger's book and Dick's
ship. What glorious boys they must have been!
This was where they used to play Curtius, and
Monte Cristo, and all manner of games; leaping
over the wall into the meadow below, deep in
fern and daisies, or swinging themselves down
by the hanging branches of the old willow that
peeped round one side of the arch. Glorious
boys! And then Hugh thought of his own
brothers, and said "Good old Jim!" under his
breath.</p>

<p>Thus musing, he was aware of a voice under
his latticed bower, as of some one in the meadow
below; a woman's voice, calm and melodious as
Margaret's own, but with a deeper and graver
note in it.</p>

<p>"What did he want then, a Lovely Person?
Did he want her to love him? Well, she did,
ardently; so that is all right."</p>

<p>A rustling followed, and the voice spoke
again:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he mustn't kiss her; that is not permitted.
He may lie at her feet, and gaze at her
with his large, brown eyes, Philip her King, but
no kissing. She is surprised at his suggesting
such a thing."</p>

<p>Hugh sat mute, in great perplexity. What
interview was this, at which he was unwillingly
assisting? Were two rustic lovers below, taking
their ease under the old willow, whose twisted
roots made an admirable seat, as he knew?
And, if so, should he be guilty of the greater
offence by keeping still, or by going away?
He knew every board in the summer-house
floor, and there was not one that would not
betray him with a loud creak; on the whole,
it seemed best to sit still; after all, they need
never know that any one was there. Hark!
the young woman&mdash;the voice was certainly
young&mdash;was speaking again:</p>

<p>"He was perfectly beautiful, that was what
he was. Yes! he had the loveliest eyes in the
world, without any exception; and his ears
were a dream of perfection, and, as for his
coat and waistcoat, words fail her to describe
them. Now if he will sit still, she will tell him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
something; no, not on her dress; a little farther
off, a precious Poppet!"</p>

<p>A curious sound followed; something between
a loud sneeze and an equally loud yawn, accompanied
with lively and prolonged rustling of the
willow branches; but no articulate word from
her companion. She seemed satisfied, however,
for she went on,&mdash;a delightful quality of
voice; Hugh felt it creeping in his ears like
music:</p>

<p>"That is right. Yes, she understands perfectly;
she knows all about it, and she loves
him to distraction. Well, Lovely One, that
Lady is a Cat; that is what she is."</p>

<p>Another sneeze and yawn, louder than before.</p>

<p>"Precisely; you think so, too. A cat! 'cat,
puss, tit, grimalkin, tabby, brindle; whoosh!'
was he fond of Dickens, a Pink-nosed Pearl?
She is no more sick than you are, Beloved. She
has been, no doubt, and now she has forgotten
how to be anything else, but she is liable to find
out. Your Aunt, beloved, proposes to put this
lady through a Course of Sprouts. Tu-whit!
your Aunt has spoken. We may also remark,
in this connection only, tu-whoo!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Her companion's only reply to this speech
was a loud breathing, which might be caused
by emotion, or by heat and fatigue; at all
events, he did not seem inclined to speak. A
thought flashed through Hugh's mind,&mdash;the
man might be a deaf-mute. What a terrible
affliction! It was bad enough to be lame; but
to be deaf, and in company with a girl with a
voice like that! Hark! she was speaking again,
slowly and meditatively, rather as if talking to
herself than to some one else:</p>

<p>"Your Aunt has not got her plan entirely
laid out yet. She knows what must finally
happen: the patient must be got out of that
house, and away on a sea-voyage; but there
will have to be various occurrences first. Your
Aunt's ingenuity, Adonis, will be put to a severe
strain. At present your Aunt is alone, and in
difficulties. Many oxen come about her, fat
bulls of Bashan compass her on every side, as
the Scripture hath it; you are not acquainted
with the Scripture, Adonis, so there is no earthly
use in your putting on that look of keen intelligence.
But there may be balm in Gilead; I
think Gilead may be in this very place above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
our head, my Popolorum Tibby. Now, what is
the matter with him?"</p>

<p>At this moment a sound was heard,&mdash;a bark,
distant at first, but coming momently nearer;
a loud, joyous, inquiring bark. It was answered
from below by a sound combining bark, sneeze,
and snort; there was a violent shaking of the
branches, and, next moment, a brown and white
setter sprang out from under the wall, and
stood at gaze. Another instant, and a second
dog, his exact image, appeared on the brow
of the slope, careering toward him. There
was a rapturous duet of barking and sneezing,
and then the two swept away over the brow,
and were gone.</p>

<p>"That is the most heartless puppy I ever
saw," the voice said, slowly. "A woodchuck,
I suppose. 'Twas ever thus. The moral is,
don't make love to strange puppies, however
beautiful; but he was lovely, and he understood
me. No more of him! The question
is, what should I find at the top of this beanstalk&mdash;I
should say, willow-tree? There is an&mdash;answer
to&mdash;every question&mdash;if&mdash;you only
ask it&mdash;quick enough!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The last words were spoken so low that Hugh
did not catch their import. Alarmed, however,
by the continued rustling of the willow branches,
he rose hurriedly to his feet, and was about to
steal away as quietly as might be; but at that
moment a hand was laid on the coping of the
wall,&mdash;a brown hand, slender but muscular;
the next moment an arm followed, and a young
woman swung herself across the opening, and,
leaning on the wall, looked full in his face.</p>

<p>It was the vision of an instant only; the
lithe figure, the face full of careless power, the
deep-set blue eyes, startling into black as they
met his, while the slender brows met above
them in angry amazement; then one hand
reached back to the willow branch, the girl
dropped from sight, and he heard her rustle
from branch to branch, and then heard the
light, swift sound of running feet through the
fern, and dying away in the distance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Is this a pleasant neighborhood, Margaret?"
asked Hugh, as they sat on the verandah
after dinner. "Have you any pleasant&mdash;a&mdash;friends,
of your own age?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"None of my own age," said Margaret. "Indeed,
our only near neighbor is Mrs. Peyton, an
invalid lady, whom I go to see quite often. She
is very charming, but&mdash;no, there is no one else;
the places are large and scattered, you see, all
about here. The next one on the other side
belongs to Miss Desmond, and she is always
abroad, and has not been here at all since I
have."</p>

<p>"You don't think she may have returned
lately, without your knowing it?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure she cannot; I heard of her
only a few days ago, in Egypt; Uncle John had
a letter from her. Why do you ask, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;idle curiosity; or curiosity, whether
idle or not. And&mdash;there are no other young
girls?"</p>

<p>"None; that is why I missed Peggy and Rita
so terribly, as I was telling you last night.
Then the dear children came, and they were
my comfort and joy; I shall have them again
when the summer is over; happy day it will be
when they come back. But, you see, having
first the girls and then the children has rather
spoiled Uncle John and me, and that is why it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was so very particularly nice of you to come,
Cousin Hugh."</p>

<p>"Suppose we drop the 'cousin,' and be just
Hugh and Margaret?" suggested her cousin.
"I am used to having sisters about me, you
know, and don't know how to get along without
them; some day it may be 'Sister Margaret.'
Should you mind?"</p>

<p>Margaret colored high with pleasure, and
again the foolish tears came into her eyes. "I
have wanted a brother all my life!" she said,
simply; and again Hugh's smile told her that
he understood all about it. He was certainly a
most wonderful person.</p>

<p>They sat in comfortable silence for a few
minutes; then&mdash;"I did not tell the exact
truth," said Margaret, "when I said there were
no young people here. Just now it happens
there is one, a newcomer, a girl of my own
age."</p>

<p>She paused. "Yes?" said Hugh, suggestively.
"Some one you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and no! I have met her once. She
is a Miss Wolfe, who has come to be a sort of
companion to Mrs. Peyton. A singular-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
girl, with a most interesting face. I want to
see her again; and yet,&mdash;somehow,&mdash;I am
rather afraid of her."</p>

<p>"Is she formidable, this she-wolf?"</p>

<p>"Not formidable, but&mdash;well, I don't know
how to describe her. She impresses me as different
from anybody I have ever seen. Wild is
not the word; Rita was wild, but it was something
totally different."</p>

<p>"Peggy is wild, too," said Hugh, "wild as a
mountain goat, or was, before you took her
in hand, Margaret. Is this young lady like
Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not in the very least. She is not shy,
not a bit; not shy, and yet not bold. She
seems simply absolutely without self-consciousness;
it is as if she said and did exactly what
she felt like doing, with no thought as to
whether it was&mdash;well, customary or not. I
am afraid I am rather conventional, Cousin&mdash;I
mean Hugh; not in thought, I hope, but&mdash;in
temperament, perhaps. This girl strikes me
very strangely; that is the only way I can
describe her. Yet she attracted me strongly,
the only time I saw her, which was the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
day you came, by the way. I ought to have
gone over to see her before this. I think I will
go this evening, while you and Uncle John are
having your after-supper smoke."</p>

<p>"I think I would," said Hugh Montfort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ALI BABA</h3>


<p>Margaret went over duly that evening,
meaning to be very friendly to the strange
young woman; but it happened to be one of
Mrs. Peyton's bad times, and she sent down
word that she needed Miss Wolfe, and could
not possibly spare her. Margaret left a civil
message, and went home disappointed, and yet
the least bit relieved: she had rather dreaded
a long t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with her new neighbor.</p>

<p>"How absurd you are, Margaret Montfort,"
she said, severely, as she walked across the
park. "Here you have been longing for a girl
to talk to, and the moment one comes, you
are seized with what Peggy calls 'the shyies,'
just because she happens to be cut from a different
pattern from your own."</p>

<p>Hugh was on the verandah, waiting for her,
and seemed really disappointed when he heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that she had not seen Miss Wolfe; that showed
how wide and cordial his interest was, and how
much thought he took for others, Margaret told
herself. What could he care about the meeting
of a cousin he had just begun to know with a
girl whom he never had seen?</p>

<p>Next day, however, she forgot all about Miss
Wolfe, for the time being. Gerald and Philip
Merryweather had accepted Mr. Montfort's invitation
with amazing alacrity, and Jean had
telegraphed her rapture of anticipation from
Ohio. Uncle John and Hugh were left to their
own devices, while she plunged, with Elizabeth
and Frances and Polly, into intricacies of hospitable
preparation. Stores must be ordered,
linen examined, silver and china looked out.
In regard to the silver, Margaret had an experience
that showed her that, even after two
years, she did not know all the resources of
Fernley House. Her uncle called her into his
study after breakfast, and handed her a key of
curious pattern. "This is the key of the iron
cupboard, Margaret," he said. Seeing her look
of surprise, he added, "You surely know about
the iron cupboard, my dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Uncle John. I remember hearing
Aunt Faith speak of something of the kind
once, but I did not rightly understand, and,
being shy then,&mdash;it was before I knew our
Dear so well,&mdash;I did not like to ask."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no mystery, my child. No
secret staircase this time, no ghosts in velvet
jackets. But in a house like Fernley, that has
been inhabited for many generations, there is
necessarily an accumulation of certain kinds of
things, above all, silver. We keep out all that
an ordinary family would be likely to use, and
the rest is stored in this safe cupboard, in case
of fire or robbery. Very stupid of me not to
have told my careful little housekeeper of this
before. To tell the truth, I forget all about
this hoard most of the time, and might not
have thought of it now, if Elizabeth had not
come to me with an important face and asked
me if I did not think Miss Margaret ought to
have the opportunity of putting out The Silver
if she wished to do so, being as the house was
to be full of company. That meant that Elizabeth
herself wanted to display to the astonished
eyes of Hugh and the Merryweather boys the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
resources of the house that she and Frances
rule (on the whole, wisely), through you and
me, their deputies and servants. I see no
reason why the good souls should not be gratified
do you?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I see every reason why
they, and I too, should be gratified. Uncle John,
I am glad I did not know about it before. It is
the most delightful thing about Fernley, that
one never seems to come to the end of it. I
thought I knew everything by this time, and
here is another enchanting mystery; for say
what you will, Uncle John, an iron cupboard
full of old silver, that nobody knows about,&mdash;or
hardly anybody,&mdash;<i>is</i> a mystery. Now I am
sure there are others, too; I shall never feel
again that I know all about the house. Some
day, when I am old and gray, I shall come upon
another secret staircase, or a trap-door, or a
hidden jewel-casket, or a lost will."</p>

<p>"Why, as to jewel-caskets," said Mr. Montfort,
smiling, "there is perhaps something that
might be said; but as you say, it would never
do to find out everything at once, May Margaret.
Run away now, and examine your tea-kettles;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
there are about forty, if I remember
rightly."</p>

<p>"Uncle John! is there really a jewel-casket?
What do you mean? There cannot be any more
than those Aunt Faith had, surely."</p>

<p>"Can't there?" said Mr. Montfort, with a provoking
smile. "Doubtless you know best, my
dear." And not another word would he say on
the subject; but he told Margaret where to find
the iron cupboard, and she ran off in such a
flutter that Peggy would hardly have known
her model and mentor. Old silver was one of
Margaret's weak points; indeed, she had a
strong feeling about heirlooms of every kind,
and treasured carefully every scrap of paper
even that had any association with past times.</p>

<p>Seeing Hugh in the library, she called to him.
"Hugh! come with me and see the Treasure
Chamber of the Montforts. Don't you want to
see the ancestral silver?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" said Hugh, laying down
his book and coming to join her. "Ancestral
silver? My mother went to housekeeping with
six teaspoons and a butter-knife, and thought
herself rich. Uncle John wanted to send a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
trunkful of family silver, I have been told, but
the Pater refused to be bothered with it. Poor
Mother would have been glad enough of it, I
fancy, but in those days he was masterful, and
bent on roughing it, and would not hear of anything
approaching luxury, or even convenience.
Where is this wonderful treasury?"</p>

<p>"Come, and you shall see. Uncle John has
told me how to find it. Come through this
door; here we are in his own study, you see.
Now&mdash;let me see! I will light this lamp&mdash;for
the cupboard is dark&mdash;while you look and find
Inigo Jones."</p>

<p>"Inigo Jones?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A tall blue morocco quarto, about the
middle of the fourth shelf of the bookcase behind
Uncle John's desk. Ah! I see him!"</p>

<p>Springing forward, Margaret drew the stately
volume from its place. "Look!" she cried.
"A keyhole. Hugh, isn't this exactly like the
'Mysteries of Udolpho?' 'Inigo Jones' is his
joke, you see, or somebody's joke. Do you
mind if I turn the key, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Turn away!" said Hugh, much amused at
the excitement of his staid little cousin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>With a trembling hand Margaret turned the
key, and gave a pull, as she had been told. A
section of the bookcase, with its load of books,
swung slowly forward, revealing a dark opening.
Margaret stepped in, and Hugh followed,
holding the lamp aloft.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he said. "I never
heard of anything like this, out of the 'Arabian
Nights.'"</p>

<p>Margaret was looking about her, too much
absorbed for words. The Iron Cupboard was a
recess some ten feet deep and seven or eight
wide, lined with shelves. These shelves were
literally packed with silver, some in boxes,
much in bags, glimmering in the half-light
like dwarfish ghosts; but the greater part uncovered,
glittering in tarnished splendor wherever
the lamplight fell. Rows upon rows of
teapots, tall and squat, round and oval, chased,
hammered, and plain; behind them, coffee-pots
looking down, in every possible device. There
were silver pitchers and silver bowls; porringers
and fruit-dishes, salvers and platters. Such an
array as might dazzle the eyes of any silversmith
of moderate ambition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Margaret," said Hugh, somewhat impressed,
but more amused, at sight of all this
hoarded treasure, "what do you say? I shall
leave the expression of emotion to you."</p>

<p>But Margaret was in no jesting mood. With
clasped hands she turned to her cousin. "Oh,
Hugh," she cried, "isn't it wonderful? to think
of all those beautiful things living here alone,&mdash;I
don't mean alone, but all by themselves&mdash;year
after year, with no one to see them, or
take them out and polish them. Oh, I never
saw such things! Look at this perfect pitcher,
will you? did you ever see anything so graceful?
This must come in, if nothing else does.
The milk shall be poured from it from this
day forward, as long as I am the Mistress of
Fernley. That is just a play-name, of course,"
she hastened to explain, blushing as she did so.
"Uncle John gave it to me in sport, when I
first began to try to keep house."</p>

<p>"It seems to me a most appropriate name,"
said Hugh. "There has never been another,
has there? in this generation, I mean. Uncle
John was never married, was he?"</p>

<p>"No; isn't it a pity? I have so often wondered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
why. I asked Aunt Faith once,&mdash;well,
Hugh, of course she was Mistress of Fernley as
long as she lived, though she would always
speak of herself as a visitor,&mdash;and she only
sighed and shook her head, and said, 'Poor
John! poor dear lad!' and then changed the
subject. But&mdash;do you suppose any one can
hear us here, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"I do not, Margaret. I should say that you
might safely tell me anything, of however fearful
a nature, in this iron-bound retreat."</p>

<p>"Oh, it really isn't anything&mdash;or perhaps it
is not&mdash;but my own fancy. I have built up a
kind of air-castle of the past, that is all. You
know Uncle John's passion for roses? Well,
and sometimes, when he is sitting quietly and
has forgotten that any one is near, he will say
to himself, 'Rose! Rose!' softly, just like that,
and as if it were something he loved to say. I
have wondered whether he once cared a great
deal for some one whose name was Rose.&mdash;What
do you think, Hugh? and she died, and that is
why he has never married. There! I have
never spoken of this before, not even to Peggy.
Don't tell any one, will you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked anxiously in her cousin's face, and
met the grave, sweet look that always made
her feel safe and quiet; she did not know how
else to express it.</p>

<p>"Tell any one? No indeed, my dear little
cousin. It is a young girl's fancy, and a very
sweet and graceful one."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think it may be true?"
asked Margaret, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Certainly it may be true; I should think it
highly probable that something of the sort had
happened, to keep a man like Uncle John single
all his days; but&mdash;well, I don't see that anything
can be done about it now, do you?"</p>

<p>"Hugh, I am afraid you are practical, after
all!" said Margaret. "And I was hoping you
would turn out romantic."</p>

<p>Hugh only laughed, and asked her if she had
chosen all the silver she wanted. This question
put a stop at once to Margaret's romantic visions.
Enough? but, she had only just begun,
she said. Did he think she was going to take
one pitcher and leave all the rest of these enchanting
treasures?</p>

<p>"And we have not explored the boxes yet!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she cried. "See, they all have dear little ivory
labels. Do reach me down that fat square box,
please! 'Col. Montfort's Tankard, 1814.' Oh,
that was our great-great-grandfather, Hugh!
Do let us open this!"</p>

<p>The black leathern box, being opened, revealed
a stately glass-bottomed tankard, with a
dragon's curling tail for a handle. On the front
was an inscription, "Presented to Col. Peter
Montfort, in token of respect and affection, by
the officers of his mess, July, 1814."</p>

<p>"His portrait is up in the long gallery," said
Margaret. "Don't you remember, with the high
ruffled stock? I don't see how he could speak,
with his chin so very high in the air. Now I
must have that oval green case; I am sure that
is something interesting. 'General Washington's
Gift.' Oh, Hugh!"</p>

<p>This time Hugh was as much interested as she,
and both bent eagerly over the box as Margaret
opened it. The case was of faded green
morocco, lined with crimson satin. Within was
an oval cup or bowl, of exquisite workmanship;
it was what is called a loving-cup, and Margaret
looked in vain for an inscription.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"There must be one!" said Hugh. "<i>Papa
Patri&aelig;</i> would not have been so unkind as to
leave such a thing unmarked. Look on the
bottom, Margaret!"</p>

<p>Margaret looked, and there, to be sure, was a
tolerably long inscription, in minute script.</p>

<p>"Hold the light nearer, please; I can hardly
read this, it is so fine. Oh, listen to this, Hugh!
'For my worthy Friend and Host, Roger Montfort
Esquire, and his estimable Lady, in grateful
Recollection of my agreeable Stay beneath
their hospitable Roof. From their obliged
Friend and Servant, G. Washington. 1776.'"</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> a treasure!" said Hugh, handling
the bowl with reverent care. "I knew that
General Washington had spent some days at
Fernley, but I never heard of this relic of his
stay. Margaret, this is really extremely interesting.
Go on, and open more of them. Perhaps
we shall find tokens of all the Continental Congress.
I shall look for at least a model of a
kite in silver, with the compliments of B. Franklin.
Suppose we try this next. It looks very
inviting."</p>

<p>He took down an oblong box of curious pattern,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and opened it. "What upon earth&mdash;Margaret,
what are these? Grape-scissors?
Asparagus-tongs? They don't look like either."</p>

<p>"I should think not!" said Margaret, taking
the object from his hand. "Why, it is a pair
of curling-tongs. What queer things! No inscription
on these; there isn't room for one.
Here is a piece of paper in the box, though."</p>

<p>She took up a yellowish scrap, and read:
"'My niece Jemima's curling-tongs, with which
she, being impatient to make a Show above her
Sisters, did burn off one Side of her Hair. Preserved
as a Warning to young Women by me,
Tabitha Montfort. 1803.' Poor Jemima! She
was punished enough, without being held up to
posterity in this way."</p>

<p>"She was an extravagant young lady," said
Hugh, "with her silver tongs; I think it may
have been good for her soul, if not her hair, to
suffer this infliction. Are you going to keep
these out, Margaret, for use? I do hope you will
be more careful than Aunt Jemima was. Your
hair&mdash;excuse me!&mdash;looks as if you had not
used the irons for some time."</p>

<p>Margaret laughed, and patted the smooth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
waves of her hair. "It <i>is</i> some time!" she said.
"Yours, on the other hand, Hugh, has more
curl than may be altogether natural. I may
have suspected you of the tongs, but at least I
have had the charity to keep my suspicions to
myself."</p>

<p>"You are extremely good, Miss Montfort.
What have you got hold of now?"</p>

<p>"'Dear Johnny's Rattle!'" said Margaret,
reading the label on a small box. "I wonder
if that was Uncle John. See! silver bells; what
a sweet tone!"</p>

<p>She shook a merry peal from the tiny bells.
Hugh, who had been rummaging at the other
end of the cupboard, replied with a clear blast
blown on a small silver trumpet, which he now
held up in triumph. "Here we are!" he cried.
"This is the instrument for me. This was
presented to Captain Hugh Montfort of the
navy. What on earth could the gallant commander
do with this at sea?"</p>

<p>"Whistle for a wind, of course," said Margaret,
merrily. "What else? Come here and
look at Grandfather Montfort's gold-bowed
spectacles; they are big enough for an ox."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>So the talk went on merrily, and box after
box, bag after bag, was opened, sometimes with
astonishing results. The bygone Montforts
seemed to have been fond of silver, and to
have vied with one another in their ingenious
applications of it to domestic uses.</p>

<p>Many of the objects had historic or personal
interest, and the two cousins might have spent
the day there, if Mr. Montfort had not suddenly
appeared, asking whether he was to have any
dinner or not. Margaret had her arms full by
this time, while Hugh was trying his best to
carry a splendid fruit-bowl, a salver, two pitchers,
and three vases, all at once. Mr. Montfort
burst out laughing at sight of the pair.
"Cassim and Ali Baba!" he cried. "And I,
the Robber Captain, with not a single one of all
the Forty Thieves at my back. Margaret, for
charity's sake! you are not going to bring all
that rubbish into the house? Isn't there enough
already? I'm sorry I told you anything about
it."</p>

<p>Margaret looked up, guilty but happy, from
her effort at capturing a fourth vase with her
little finger, the only one left unencumbered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
"Dear Uncle, you never would be so cruel!"
she said. "See! I have only taken one chocolate-pot,
and there are five, such beauties!
Yes, I know we don't drink chocolate, but some
of our guests might, and you would not have
me neglect the guests, would you, Uncle
John?"</p>

<p>"Sooner than have a guest take his chocolate
from a china pot," said Mr. Montfort, gravely,
"I would go to the stake. At present, if you
will pardon a very old joke, my dear Margaret,
I should prefer to go to the beefsteak, which I
have reason to think is on the table at this
moment. Come out, both of you young thieves,
and let Inigo Jones go in again!"</p>

</p><h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MORE ARRIVALS</h3>


<div class="figright" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="146" height="300" alt="&quot;SHE WAS A SLENDERER PEGGY, WITH THE SAME BLUE, HONEST EYES.&quot;" title="&quot;SHE WAS A SLENDERER PEGGY, WITH THE SAME BLUE, HONEST EYES.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE WAS A SLENDERER PEGGY, WITH THE SAME BLUE, HONEST EYES.&quot;</span>
</div><p>The great day came, the day of the arrivals.
Jean was the first to come, by an early train,
having arrived in New York the night before,
where Hugh met her and brought her in triumph
to Fernley. Margaret was at the door to
receive her, and Peggy's sister had no cause
to complain of the warmth of her reception.
She was a slenderer Peggy, with the same blue,
honest eyes, the same flaxen hair and rosy
cheeks. Her dress, however, was far more
tasteful and neat than Peggy's had been on
her first arrival. Margaret recalled the green
flannel, all buttoned awry, and looked with approval
on Jean's pretty gray travelling-dress.</p>

<p>"Dear Jean!" she said, kissing her cousin
warmly. "Most welcome to Fernley, dear
child! Oh, I am so glad to see you! I have
been counting the days, Jean."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, so have I!" said Jean, looking up with
a shy, sweet smile,&mdash;Peggy's very own smile.
Margaret kissed her again for it. "The last
day did seem awfully long, Cousin Margaret&mdash;well,
Margaret, then! I'm sure I never call
you anything but Peggy's Margaret when I
think of you. Peggy hasn't come yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. She will be here this afternoon,
on the three o'clock train. She knows nothing
about your coming, Jean. In her very last
letter, she was talking about being glad to
come here, and so on, and she said the only
thing wanting would be you."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody! I'm awfully glad&mdash;that she
doesn't know, I mean. It will be just lovely
to surprise her. Dear old Peg!" Jean relapsed
into bashful silence when Margaret took her
into the library to greet her uncle; but Mr.
Montfort's smile and cordial greeting soon put
her at her ease.</p>

<p>"Isn't he just lovely?" she whispered to
Margaret, as they went up-stairs. "I was
afraid he would be awful, somehow, but he
isn't a bit; he's just lovely."</p>

<p>Margaret assented, making a mental note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the fact that this child seemed to have but
two adjectives in her vocabulary. "Peggy will
see to that!" she said to herself. "Peggy has
improved so wonderfully in her English this
last year. She will be quicker than I to notice
and take up the little mistakes."</p>

<p>This was not strictly true, though modest
Margaret meant it so. Peggy certainly had
learned much at school, but her teachers had
no expectation of her becoming an eminent
English scholar.</p>

<p>"I have put you with Peggy," said Margaret,
leading the way into the pretty room, hung
with red-poppy chintz, where Peggy had spent
a few sad and many happy hours. "I thought
you would rather be together."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed! You are awfully kind,
Cous&mdash;Margaret. I haven't seen Peggy for
a year, you know. We missed her awfully at
Christmas, of course, but she had a lovely time
here; and it would have been awful if she
had come home and got the measles, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we did have a very good time. The
children were here,&mdash;Basil and Susan D.,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
they and Peggy were fast friends. Oh, yes, it
was a great holiday. Now, dear, you will want
to rest a little, so I will leave you. Peggy will
not be here till after lunch, so you will have
time for a good rest, and to explore the garden,
too, if you like. I am going now to arrange
my flowers."</p>

<p>"Oh, might I help? I am not a bit tired, and
I just love to arrange flowers. Do let me help,
Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Margaret, with a little
inward sigh. She had her own ideas, and very
definite ones, about the arrangement of flowers,
in which she had exquisite taste; and her recollection
of the way in which Peggy used to
squeeze handfuls of blossoms tight into a vase,
without regard to color or form, made her dread
the assistance so heartily proffered; but Jean
was quicker than Peggy had been at her age,
and one glance at Margaret's first "effect," a
rainbow combination of sweet-peas, showering
over the side of a crystal bowl, filled her with
ambition to emulate its beauty. The morning
passed happily and busily, the more so that
Hugh came in presently, with a chapter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Thoreau that Margaret "really must hear!"
He read well, and his taste and Margaret's
being much alike, they spent many pleasant
hours together, he reading aloud, she with her
flowers or her work. Jean, who had never
heard of Thoreau, and was not bookish, tried
to listen, but did not make much of it. She
fell to meditating instead, and her bright eyes
wandered curiously from one intent face to the
other. Hugh never thought of reading aloud
at home. To be sure, he was the only one who
cared about reading, or had time for it. He
and Margaret seemed to know each other very
well, seeing what a short time he had been here.
Jean, with all the eager romance of fifteen,
straightway began the building of an air-castle,
which seemed to her a fine structure indeed.
Meantime, Hugh and Margaret, all unconscious
of her scrutiny, were enjoying themselves extremely.</p>

<p>"'As polishing expresses the vein in marble
and grain in wood, so music brings out what of
heroic lurks anywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we are in
health, all sounds fife and drum to us; we hear
notes of music in the air, or catch its echoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
dying away when we awake in the dawn.
Marching is when the pulse of the hero beats
in unison with the pulse of Nature, and he steps
to the measure of the universe; then there is
true courage and invincible strength.'"</p>

<p>"How beautiful that is!" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is the particular passage I wanted
to read to you. Have you ever had that feeling,
fancying that you wake to the sound of music?
I often have, when I have been sleeping out in
the open&mdash;never within doors."</p>

<p>"No," said Margaret, "I don't think I ever
have, Hugh; but what a pleasant thing it must
be! I have never slept in the open, but even if
I should, I fear my waking would be plain prose,
like myself."</p>

<p>Hugh laughed, and glanced at her affectionately.
"I haven't found much prose about you,
Margaret," he said. "If I had, I should not
have read you my secrets when Thoreau tells
them for me. That reminds me, do you sing?
I have not heard you, have I?"</p>

<p>"No; I wish I did, for I love music very
much. Oh, I sing a very little, enough to
join in a chorus&mdash;if there ever were a chorus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at Fernley. I used to enjoy Rita's singing intensely;
she has a very sweet voice."</p>

<p>"Some one was singing last night," Hugh
went on; "I don't know why, but this passage
reminds me&mdash;I heard a woman's voice singing,&mdash;a
remarkable voice."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Where were you? Not in your
room? I am sure there is no one in the house
who sings."</p>

<p>"No; it was pretty warm, and the moon&mdash;well,
you remember, it was all you could do to
go to bed yourself, Margaret. After Virtue, in
the shape of yourself and Uncle John, had gone
to bed, Vice, in my shape, wandered about the
garden, I don't know how long. It was wonderful
there, with the trees, and the smell of
the roses and box, and&mdash;and the whole thing,
you know. Down at the foot of the garden,
over in the meadow below, some one was singing;
some one with a remarkable voice; rather
deep-toned, not loud, and yet full, with an extraordinary
degree of melody; or, so it seemed
at a distance. I wondered who it was, that
was all. You have no idea, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No! I wonder too, very much. No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from this house, I am sure of that. Now that
I think of it, though, Polly sings&mdash;Polly, the
under housemaid; she has a pretty little bird-like
voice, but nothing such as you describe.
I'll make inquiries, though&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't!" said Hugh, hastily, "I'd
rather not! I&mdash;I mean, of course, it is not
of the smallest consequence, Margaret. It is
pleasant to hear singing at night, but perhaps
all the pleasanter when the singer is unseen
and unknown. Now let us go on with our
Thoreau."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Margaret! Margaret! Margaret!"</p>

<p>It was all Peggy could say at first. All the
way up the avenue her heart had been beating
high; at sight of the brown chimney-stacks of
Fernley, it seemed to give a great jump up in
her throat; and when the carriage swept round
the curve, and she saw the whole front of the
great house, and Margaret, her own Margaret,
standing on the steps, with arms outstretched
to welcome her, there was nothing for it but to
cry out, with the full power of her healthy
lungs. Almost before Bannan could stop the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
horses, she had scrambled out, and was on her
cousin's neck, strangling her with hugs, and
smothering her with kisses at the same instant.
"Margaret! Margaret! I am really here! Do
you know that I am really here?"</p>

<p>Speech was impossible for Margaret, but a
voice from behind broke in:</p>

<p>"Come, come! what is all this? My niece
done to death on my own doorstep? Let go,
Peggy, and come and kill me instead. I am
older, and shall be less missed."</p>

<p>Peggy loosed her hold, somewhat abashed,
but received an embrace from her uncle so
warm that she brightened again instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John, how do you do? It was
only that I was so glad to see my darling Margaret.
Did I hurt you, dearest? I have pulled
all your lovely hair down; Margaret, I am more
clumsy than ever, I do believe."</p>

<p>"Dear Peggy! as if I cared whether you are
clumsy or not! though it is convenient to have
the use of my windpipe, I confess. Well, and
here you are, indeed. Why, Peggy!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"<i>Why, Peggy!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear! what is the matter? Is my hat
wrong side before? I know my necktie is
crooked, but I couldn't help that, truly I
couldn't, Margaret; the strap is broken, and
it will work round under my ear. I'll mend
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't looking at your necktie, child.
Peggy, you are taller than I am! How dare
you, miss?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret! I really thought I had
done something&mdash;why, yes, so I am taller; but
only just the least little bit, Margaret."</p>

<p>"And your shoulders&mdash;why, Peggy, you are
a great big creature! How can any one grow
so in six months? We shall have to call you
Brynhild."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Peggy, simply. "I
haven't grown enough to understand outlandish
words, Margaret, so you need not try them
on me. Oh,"&mdash;she looked around her with
delighted eyes,&mdash;"how beautiful everything
looks, Uncle John. Why, the yellow birch has
grown as much as I have; it is quite a fat
tree. And&mdash;you have put out more chestnuts,
haven't you? And&mdash;oh, Uncle John, I haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
told you my great news! The most wonderful
news! I wouldn't write about it, because
I wanted to surprise you. Hugh, our Hugh,
is coming East. He is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is he?" said another voice, and
Hugh came forward laughing, and took his
sister in his arms. "Well, little girl,&mdash;big,
enormous, colossal little girl, how are you?
Shut your eyes, Peg of Limavaddy, or they will
drop out, and then what should we do?"</p>

<p>"Hugh! what does it mean? When&mdash;how
did you get here? You weren't to start till
next week."</p>

<p>"So I wasn't," said Hugh, composedly. "But
you see I did. If you are not glad to see me,
Margaret will let me stay in the back kitchen,
I am sure, till you go away."</p>

<p>Peggy's only reply was a hug as powerful as
the one she had given Margaret; it set her
brother coughing and laughing till the tears
came to his eye. "My dear sister," he said,
"have you been studying grips with a grizzly
bear? I felt one rib go, if not two."</p>

<p>"Not really, Hugh? I didn't really hurt
you?" cried Peggy, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no! not really. See now, Margaret
wants you. Run along, Samsonina."</p>

<p>Peggy ran into the house, casting delighted
glances all about her.</p>

<p>"How beautiful the hall looks! Oh, Margaret,
what flowers! why, it is a perfect flower
show! Did you do them all yourself? for
me? Oh, you darling!" and again Margaret's
breath was extinguished by a powerful embrace.
"And, oh, the surprise of seeing Hugh!
You know I love a surprise. You planned
it for me, didn't you, darling Margaret? You
are the most angelic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! no extravagance!"</p>

<p>"No, Margaret, I won't. Only how can I
help it, when I am so happy, and you are
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Margaret fairly laid her hand over
Peggy's mouth. "I did not plan Hugh's coming,"
she said. "I was as much surprised, and
as pleasantly, as you, Peggy. He came earlier
than he had expected, on account of some business
for Uncle James. Only, we all agreed
that we would not tell you, because we knew
your fondness for surprises. Do you think you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
could bear another, Peggy, or is this enough
for to-day?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Margaret? There
can't be anything more. Nothing could count
after the joy of seeing Hugh. Oh, Margaret,
isn't he dear? Don't you love him?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" said Margaret, heartily.
"You never said half enough about him, Peggy.
Oh, we are such friends, Uncle John and Hugh
and I. But is there no other thing you can
think of that you would like, Peggy, dear? No
one else you would like very, very much to
see?"</p>

<p>They were now at the door of Peggy's room,
and Margaret's hand was on the door. Peggy
turned and looked at her in wonder. "What
do you mean, Margaret? Why do you look
like that?" At this moment a sound was
heard on the other side of the door, something
between a cry, a sniffle, and a sob.</p>

<p>"Who is in there?" cried Peggy, her eyes
opening to their fullest and roundest extent.</p>

<p>"Go in and see," said Margaret, and she
opened the door and pushed Peggy gently in,
and shut it again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard a great cry. "Jean! my Jean!"
"Oh, Peggy! Peggy!" then kissing and hugging;
and then sounds which made her open
the door and come quickly into the room.
Peggy and Jean were seated on the floor, side
by side, their heads on each other's shoulder,
crying as if their hearts would break.</p>

</p><h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF</h3>


<p>"Well, Jean!"</p>

<p>"Well, Peggy!"</p>

<p>"What do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think they are just lovely. I like the
tall one best, don't you? Though the red-haired
one is awfully nice, too."</p>

<p>"Goose! I didn't mean them. I meant
Uncle John and Margaret. Aren't they dear?
Did I say half enough about them, Jean?"</p>

<p>"No, not half. Margaret is just too lovely
for anything, and Uncle John&mdash;well, of course,
I am awfully afraid of him, but he is just lovely,
too."</p>

<p>"Look here, young one!" said Peggy the
Venerable, gravely. "Can't you say anything
except 'awful' and 'lovely?' I would enlarge
my vocabulary, if I were you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean opened her eyes to their roundest.
"Vocabulary! What's that? Don't tell me
that you are going to set up for a school-teacher,
Peggy. Why, you used to say 'awful'
yourself, all the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Jean, not quite all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, awfully often, anyhow. I know you
did."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jean, I know I did. But first Margaret
told me about it, and then I began to notice for
myself. I've been taking Special English this
year, and I find I notice more and more. It's
really a pity, as Margaret says, to have only two
or three words and work them to death, when
there are so many good ones that we never
use at all. Grace used to call it 'Cruelty to
Syllables.'"</p>

<p>"Well, what shall I say? I don't know
anything else."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do; don't be absurd, child. Margaret
made me a list of adjectives and adverbs
once, I remember, the first time I was here; I
was just your age then, Jean, and I have no
doubt I <i>did</i> say 'awfully' most of the time;
anyhow, I did it enough to trouble Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
aw&mdash;very much indeed. Let me see: there is
'very,' of course; 'remarkably, extremely, uncommonly,
exceedingly, and excessively;' then
for adjectives, 'charming, delightful, pretty,
exquisite, pleasant, agreeable, entertaining,'&mdash;well,
there were a great many more, but that is
all I can think of now; all these will do instead
of 'awful' and 'lovely,' Jean."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy, dear, you are a regular school-ma'am.
Please don't let us talk about all these
horrid things, the first night I am here. I am
perfectly dying to know what you think about
the two Mr. Merryweathers, and about Hugh
and Margaret."</p>

<p>"Why, I think the Merryweathers seem very
nice boys indeed. I like the funny one best, I
think; Gerald, is his name? But the other
one is nice, too. He has such kind eyes, and
such a pleasant voice. Somehow he looks more
like Gertrude than Gerald does, even though
Gerald has her hair. Oh, Jean, I wish you could
see my Snowy Owl! She is so dear, and beautiful,
and strong; next to you and Margaret,
she is the very dearest girl in the world, except
one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I come in?" said Margaret's voice at
the door. She was greeted by a duet of "Come
in, do!" and entering, found her two cousins
seated on the floor, hair-brush in hand, brushing
out their long fair hair.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Maud and Madge in their robes of white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The prettiest nightgowns under the sun!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>quoted Margaret. "How comfortable you look,
girls! May I do my hair here, too? I knew
you would be sitting up, chattering. Who is
the very dearest girl in the world except one,
Peggy? And who is the one? I heard the
end of your sentence before I knocked."</div>

<p>"Yes, but you didn't hear the beginning,"
said Peggy, "or you would know that you two
here are the <i>very</i> dearest, and that the others
only come after you. I was speaking of Gertrude
Merryweather; oh! how you and she will
love each other, Margaret! I don't see how I
can wait to have you know each other. And
by the 'except one,' I meant Grace Wolfe, our
Horny Owl, and our Goat, and a good many
other things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she now?" asked Margaret.
"Have you heard from her lately?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, sadly. "None of us
have heard at school. She wrote Miss Russell
some time ago that she was going to try a new
departure, and expected either to go mad or
make her fortune; but she didn't say what it
was. She never writes many letters, you know.
We have all written again and again, but it
makes no difference. Hark! what is that
noise?"</p>

<p>"What noise? I heard nothing," said
Margaret.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard some one speak, outside
the window."</p>

<p>They listened for a moment, but all was
quiet.</p>

<p>"It may have been Uncle John and Hugh in
the garden," said Margaret. "It is early yet,
you know, not ten o'clock; they often walk
about for an hour and more after we come up.
Speaking of Grace Wolfe, Peggy,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tu-whit!" said a voice. "In this connection
only, I may be permitted to remark, tu-whoo!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Grace!</i>" cried Peggy, in such a voice that
the other girls sprang to their feet. Peggy was
at the window before them, snatching back the
curtain. The night was warm, and the upper
sash had been lowered completely. Leaning
over the sash was a slender figure shimmering
white in the moonlight. "Any admittance for
the Goat?" said a deep, melodious voice.
"Peace, Innocent!" for Peggy was trying to
drag her in over the sash by main force.</p>

<p>"I address the mistress of the dwelling. Is
there admittance for a miscellaneous quadruped,
Margaret Montfort?"</p>

<p>But now Margaret had her other hand, and
laughing and crying, the girls had her in, and
again Peggy displayed the powerful development
of her muscles in a strangling embrace,
from which Grace emerged panting, but unruffled.
Giving Peggy a sedate kiss, she turned
to Margaret, who still held her hand, gazing in
wonder and bewilderment; for this was Mrs.
Peyton's companion.</p>

<p>"You pardon the informality?" she said;
and her smile was like light in the room. "I
could not come to call on Peggy, or on Peggy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Margaret, with my bonnet on. And it is a
<i>great</i> wall to climb!" she added, wistfully.
"I don't know when I have enjoyed myself so;
there is little climbing in these sad days. Now
you see why I did not want to be Miss Fox."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" cried Margaret. "How
could you keep me in the dark? How stupid&mdash;how
utterly stupid of me, not to know you!
And yet, how could I have guessed that Mrs.
Peyton's companion was Peggy's own beloved
Grace? You must be my Grace, too, please;
I will have neither wolves nor foxes, but only
Grace, or the Horned Owl."</p>

<p>She kissed Grace, who returned the kiss
warmly. But now Peggy, who had been silent
for a moment in sheer amazement, broke in:</p>

<p>"What does this all mean?" she cried.
"Have you dropped from the moon, Grace
Wolfe, or where do you come from? You and
Margaret have met before? Where, and how,
and when? I must know all about it, this very
instant."</p>

<p>The situation was soon explained. Jean, who
had hung back, shy and frightened, was brought
forward and introduced; and soon all four girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
were seated comfortably on the floor, talking as
if nothing astonishing had happened. Only
every few minutes Peggy would put her hand
out and touch Grace's shoulder, as if to make
sure that she was genuine flesh and blood, and
not some phantom conjured up out of the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I have tried twice to see you," Margaret
said. "Both times I seemed to have come just
at the wrong moment. Do tell me how you are
getting on, Grace! How has Mrs. Peyton been
since you have been there? It is very seldom
that I am so many days without seeing her."</p>

<p>"Singular lady!" said Grace. "Beautiful,
but singular. She thinks me mad, so matters
are equal. Why, we get on&mdash;somewhere! I
am not sure where. At present, I am in disgrace.
She did not like her chocolate this
morning, and being in a pet, bade me throw it
out of window; I obeyed. It appears the cup
was valuable, which was a pity, as its bones are
scattered far and wide."</p>

<p>"You threw the cup, too? Grace!"</p>

<p>"Naturally I threw the cup. I am going on
the principle of doing exactly what she tells me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to do; thus she may discover the unreason of
her conduct. Tu-whit! Yesterday she was displeased
with an embroidered muslin jacket, and
said she never wanted to see it again. I tore it
up; she was displeased. To-night she took a
dislike to my dress, and told me not to come
near her till morning. Behold me here; I think
it probable that at this moment she is raising the
house for me and desiring greatly to be rubbed.
These things are instructive to her. I have
put her to sleep every night by rubbing, and
now she will not sleep. Poor lady; so sad for
her!"</p>

<p>All this was said quietly, pensively, with an
air of mild consideration. Margaret looked at
her, wondering. No one had ever crossed Mrs.
Peyton before. One "companion" after another
had been engaged, been tyrannized over
for a few weeks, and then dismissed. What
would be the effect of this opposite treatment?
Timid herself, she had always met the vagaries
of her beautiful friend with, at most, a gentle
protest. If matters were too bad, she stayed
away for a week, and was sure to find the lady
in her most winning mood at the end of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
time; but she had never attempted any more
severe measure than this.</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;do you feel as if you were
getting hold of her at all, Grace?" she asked.
"She is really very fascinating, when she wants
to be."</p>

<p>"I am not fascinated!" said Grace; and for
a moment the half-whimsical, half-reckless look,
which was her usual expression, gave way to one
that was stern enough. "Mrs. Peyton appears
to me to be a wholly selfish person; a thing
rarely met with in such entirety. I have promised
my Good Physician that I will try to rouse
her, and see if there is any scrap of woman left
inside this pretty shell; I am going to do my
best. I think it doubtful if there is, but I am
going to do my best."</p>

<p>Peggy gazed at her with adoring eyes
and felt absolute assurance that Mrs. Peyton
would shortly be converted into an angel.
Did not Grace always do what she undertook
to do?</p>

<p>With one of her sudden movements, Grace
turned to her, and put her hands on her shoulders.
"Behold my Innocent happy!" she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"What of the other Owls, Babe? Do they hoot
happily, and flap friskily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Grace, they want to hear from you so
much! The Snowy is really anxious. She is
afraid you are sick, or&mdash;or something. Do
write to her, dear; won't you?"</p>

<p>"The Snowy," said Grace, "is one of the few
wholly satisfactory persons in the world. I have
an immense respect for the Snowy, as well as a
strong affection. If I could write to anybody, I
think it would be to her. It may even be done,
Innocent. Who knows?"</p>

<p>"She was afraid&mdash;" Peggy hesitated.</p>

<p>"She was afraid," said Grace, coolly, "that I
was going on the variety stage. Yes; but you
see, I did not. But I admit there are grounds&mdash;yes,
I will write, Innocent. And now I must
go," she added, rising. "I may come again, Margaret?
Tie a white ribbon on the window-tassel
when you do not want me. Good night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, my dear, you are not going out in
that way!" cried Margaret, in distress. "Why
not go down-stairs and out of the door, like a
Christian?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing distinctively unchristian, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hold, in going by way of the window," replied
Grace, her hand already on the sash. "Consider,
I pray you, the rapture of the one method, the
futile stupidity of the other. Enough! I am
gone."</p>

<p>She slipped lightly over the sill and was gone,
leaving the others staring at each other. Peggy
ran to the window and looked after her. "She
is all right, Margaret!" she cried; for Margaret
was visibly distressed and alarmed. "The woodbine
is very thick and strong, and there is the
spout, too. There! She is down now, all safe.
Good night! oh, good night, dear Goat!"</p>

<p>About this time, Hugh Montfort, having said
good night to his uncle and the two Merryweathers,
sauntered down the garden walk, for
one more turn, one more look at the night. It
was a wonderful night. The moon was full,
and Fernley lay bathed in a flood of silver light,
that seemed to transform the old brown house
into a fairy palace, stately and splendid. There
was no wind, and no sound broke the stillness;
yes, it might well be an enchanted palace, where
every living thing lay fast bound by some
mighty spell. The leaves drooped motionless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
from the branches; beyond the dark masses of
trees, the broad lawns lay in green and silver.</p>

<p>"It's more like something Greek!" said
Hugh. "Tempe, or some such place. If a
dryad, now, were to come out from that great
tulip-tree&mdash;good heavens!"</p>

<p>He stopped short, in the deep shadow of a
clump of chestnut-trees. Something moved,
behind the very tree he was looking at. A
figure came lightly out into the open; a woman's
figure, slight and supple, clad in shadowy white.
A dryad? No! the girl he had seen in the
summer-house. He knew the face, as it shone
upturned in the moonlight; knew the firm
mouth and chin, the blue eyes, the look of careless
power; seen once only, it was as if he had
known the face all his life.</p>

<p>What was she doing? A smile lighted her
grave eyes suddenly. She extended her arms,
her face still raised to the moon. Her whole
figure, light as thistle-down, began to sway, to
drift hither and thither over the silver-green
lawn. Dancing, was she? It was no human
dance, surely; the name was too common for
this marvel of motion. A wave cresting and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
curling toward its break; a cloud blown lightly
along a summer sky by a gentle wind; a field of
grain, bending and rippling under the same wind.
Hugh thought of all these things, and rejected
each in turn, as unworthy of comparison to this,
the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He
watched her, as if in a dream of delight; each
moment it seemed that he must wake, and find
the lovely vision gone. It was too rare, too
perfect to be real. It seemed as if all the moonlight
in the world were drawn to this one spot,
to shine on that white figure, dancing, swaying,
hither and thither&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! it was over. She stopped; threw, it
seemed, some words upward toward the moon,
accompanying them with a wave of her hand.
Then she turned away, and passed slowly out of
sight, under the dark trees. As she went, she
began to sing; softly at first, a mere breath of
sound; but as she passed farther and farther on,
her song rang out clear and sweet; the voice
and the song that he had heard the night before,
in the field beyond the wall:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Trois anges sont venus ce soir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">M'apportaient de bien belles choses!"</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR</h3>


<p>"Jerusalem!" said Philip Merryweather.</p>

<p>"And Madagascar!" responded his twin
brother. "Well, what did I tell you, old
Towser?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but last night, you see, I was
half-asleep, and didn't see it all. This is what I
call a room."</p>

<p>Phil sat up in bed, and looked about the great
nursery, into which the early sun was shining
brightly.</p>

<p>"The bigness of it!" he said, "if nothing
more. You could have quite a track round this,
do you know it? Most rooms are all walls; I
hate walls. Shove the furniture into the middle,
and chalk a six-foot track&mdash;hey? What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"This!" replied Gerald, throwing a pillow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with accurate aim. "Does it occur to your
arboreal, if not river-drift mind, that there are
people under this room? Heehaw! excuse me
for not sooner addressing you in your own language.
Here, belay that! I want to know
what you think of them all."</p>

<p>"Jolly!" was Phil's brief but emphatic verdict.
But Gerald seemed to demand something
more. "Isn't Mr. Montfort the most corking
person you ever saw?"</p>

<p>"Except three, I should say he was. That
lame chap is a corker, too. Reminds me a bit
of the Codger, I don't know why."</p>

<p>"So he does!" said Gerald, eagerly. "I
didn't see it before. Queer stunt, too, because
she always makes me think of Hildegarde."</p>

<p>"Who? Miss Peggy? I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! Who said anything about Miss
Peggy? Miss Montfort, of course."</p>

<p>"They are all Miss Montforts. You mean
Miss Margaret? Well&mdash;I see what you mean.
She hasn't Hildegarde's beauty, though. Very
attractive, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean!" said Gerald, eagerly.
"There's something of that quiet way, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
takes hold of you and&mdash;oh, I didn't mean
that they would be taken for sisters. Look
here, Elderly Ape, was you thinking of getting
up, or should I bring his gruel, and feed him
wiz a 'poon, a pretty toddlekins?"</p>

<p>"A pretty toddlekins will break your pretty
noddlekins," replied Philip. "Avast there, and
heave sponges!" And the conversation ended
in a grand splashing duet executed in two enormous
bath-tubs that stood in different corners of
the great room.</p>

<p>It was a merry party that met at breakfast.
John Montfort looked round the table with
pleasure, and wondered how he had ever sat
here alone, year after year, when this kind of
thing was to be had, apparently for the asking.
Margaret's sweet face, opposite him, was radiant;
it struck Mr. Montfort that he had never
seen her look so pretty before. The delicate
rose-flush on her cheek, the light in her eyes,
an indescribable air of gaiety, of lightness,
about her whole figure&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, this is what she needed!" said Mr.
Montfort to himself. "The children were all
very well; I am all very well myself, for an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
uncle, but children and old uncles are not all
that a lassie needs. Ah, well, it is all as it
should be. We remember, Rose!"</p>

<p>Gerald, at Margaret's left hand, was talking
eagerly. If her face was radiant, his was
sparkling. For the first time in his life, it
is probable, he seemed to take little heed of
his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the thunder-storm, Miss
Montfort? and the way that little chap ran
around the long corridor? He's going to make
a great runner some day. Cork&mdash;very nice
little fellow. You say he isn't here now? I'm
sorry! I wanted the Ape to see him."</p>

<p>"The Ape?"</p>

<p>"The Old Un. My brother, Long-leggius
Ridiculus. Christian name Philip, but what
has he done that I should call him that?"</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. She did not fully understand,
but everything Gerald said seemed to her
funny. "What does he call you?" she asked.
"Or do you invent new names every day? Last
night I heard you calling him&mdash;what was it?
Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus?"</p>

<p>"It might have been!" said Gerald, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
modest pride. "I can 'gleek upon occasion.'
I can also sling a syllable with the next man.
It is only at monosyllables that I draw the
line. When I call him Ape, I have to tack an
adjective to it, or things happen. Miss Montfort,
you don't know how glad I was to come.
It was awfully kind of Mr. Montfort to ask us.
I've always wanted to come again, and I didn't
know when I should have a chance. There&mdash;there
isn't any other place like this in the world,
I believe. I've told the Ape a lot about it, and
he was keen to see it, too. What a cork&mdash;that
is, what an extremely fine fellow your cousin
appears to be."</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I ask," said Margaret; "is
'cork' a complimentary term?"</p>

<p>Gerald blushed. "Why, you see," he said,
rather ruefully, "I made up my mind that I
would drop it when I came here. 'Corker,'
and 'corking'&mdash;well, it means that a person
is all right, don't you know? That he's awfully
jolly, and&mdash;and&mdash;corking, in short. It's the
thing fellows say nowadays. I get into the way
of it, and then I go home, and the Mater says
things to me. She doesn't like slang, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
course you don't either, Miss Montfort. I'll try
not to do it again, truly I will."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't mind that kind of slang!"
said Margaret; and she wondered at herself
even as she spoke. "It&mdash;it seems so funny,
somehow. I suppose when slang is really
funny&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up and caught her uncle looking
at her with an expression of amusement. She
blushed in her turn, stammered, and took refuge
behind her coffee-urn.</p>

<p>Meantime Peggy and Philip had fallen deep
in conversation. He was the brother of Gertrude
Merryweather, the beloved Snowy Owl
of Peggy's happiest school-days; that was
enough for Peggy. She was used to boys and
brothers, and felt none of the shyness that
often made Margaret's tongue trip and stammer
in spite of her two years' advantage. Peggy
was full of eager questionings:</p>

<p>"How is she looking? dear lovely thing!
Do you think she will go to college this fall?
Oh, do try to make her! I do so want to have
her back again,&mdash;near us, I mean. The Fluffy
enters this fall, you know; the Snowy ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
come, too. Do try to make her, won't you,
Mr. Merryweather?"</p>

<p>Phil looked grave. "Said the kangaroo to
the duck, this requires a little reflection!" he
said. "The child Toots has her good points, as
you observe, Miss Montfort. She is a rather
nice child, and we like to have her at home.
She has been at this old school three years, and
I don't see the good of sisters if they are somewhere
else all the time. Not that I should wish
to stand in the way of the child Toots; but you
see, Bell is off, too, and the Mater has been
having things the matter with her,&mdash;rheumatism
and that,&mdash;and the child Toots is useful at
home,&mdash;uncommon useful she is."</p>

<p>"Oh! but&mdash;of course I'm aw&mdash;dreadfully
sorry your mother isn't well; but&mdash;but Gertrude
wants to come, doesn't she? Oh, well,
I shall hope it will be all right. And oh! what
do you think, Mr. Merryweather? The most
astonishing thing happened last night. I must
write and tell Gertrude all about it. The Horny
is near here."</p>

<p>"The Horny? Not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grace Wolfe. Think of it! Do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
know her? Well, of course Gertrude has told
you all about her. She is the most wonderful
person in the world, and she is living close by
here, taking care of some one,&mdash;you know she
means to be a nurse. You know how wonderful
she was when that poor girl was so sick at school&mdash;and
she has been staying at Doctor Flower's,
and he persuaded her to come and take care of
this lady. You must see her,&mdash;I want everybody
to see her. She isn't like anybody else,
you know. Why, just when you look at her
you feel that; I don't know what it is,&mdash;I can't
explain,&mdash;but it's there. And then her voice!
When she sings, it's&mdash;it's like magic, somehow.
Oh, dear! I wish I could express myself; I never
know how to say things."</p>

<p>"You are saying them beautifully!" said
gallant Philip. "Besides, of course, Toots has
told me a good deal about your wonderful friend.
Does she still go climbing all about, disdaining
doors and stairs, and using windows instead?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" said Peggy. "I don't know
whether we are to speak of it or not, but&mdash;she
came up the wall, and in at our window last
night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she did. Don't tell anybody, because
she might not like it. She fluttered in like a
bird, and stayed awhile, and then fluttered out
again. And then&mdash;we heard her singing in
the distance as she went back, and really and
truly, it seemed like fairy music."</p>

<p>Something made Peggy look up at this moment,
and she caught Hugh Montfort's eyes
fixed on her with so intent a gaze that she
stumbled and blushed, and thought she had
said something wrong. "Don't ask me anything
about it," she murmured to her neighbor.
"Perhaps&mdash;they may not like to have people
climb up the walls here; I wouldn't get Grace
into trouble for twenty worlds."</p>

<p>"Hugh," said Mr. Montfort, "I am going to
get you to do the honors of the garden and
stables to these young gentlemen, as I am busy
this morning. The girls have a dozen plans, no
doubt; but perhaps Peggy and Jean would like
to go with you and see the puppies, while Margaret
sees to her housekeeping. How does that
suit you all?"</p>

<p>Every one acquiesced in the arrangement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and, as they went out into the garden, Peggy
managed to slip beside her brother.</p>

<p>"What did I say that was wrong, Hugh?
You were looking at me as if I had done all
kinds of things. Would Uncle John mind her
climbing up the wall, do you think? She
couldn't possibly hurt it; she is light as a
feather; and Margaret didn't say anything
about her not doing it again."</p>

<p>A faint color crept into Hugh's brown cheek.</p>

<p>"My dear little Peggy," he said, "you must
not be so imaginative. It is a new trait in
you. What possible objection could there be
to a young lady climbing up the wall if she
enjoys it? It seemed&mdash;a little unusual, I suppose,
and so I was interested. Was I indiscreet?
I hardly supposed you would be having
confidences with young Merryweather quite so
soon."</p>

<p>"Hugh, don't be ridiculous. Then it's all
right, and I am so glad! Thank you, dear."</p>

<p>She was springing away, but Hugh called her
back.</p>

<p>"One moment, Peggy. This&mdash;this friend
of yours seems to be a remarkable person. Has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
she other accomplishments besides climbing?
Did I hear you speak of singing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Hugh, I wish you could hear her sing!
You might have heard her last night, if you had
only been out. It was full moon, and the moon
makes her mad, she says. Anyhow, when the
moon is out she is wilder than ever, fuller of&mdash;whatever
it is that she is full of; I don't know,
something like a spirit, or a bird. Once I saw
her dance in the moonlight, and I shall never
forget it as long as I live."</p>

<p>"No more shall I," said Hugh, under his
breath. "Thank you, Peggy," he said aloud.
"Don't let me keep you, my dear; or were you
coming with us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Hugh; I want to do so
many things, all at once. I want to show Jean
the house, and the garden, and the summer-houses,
and&mdash;oh! oh, you darlings! you beauties!
Hugh, do look at these lovely duckies!"</p>

<p>The "lovely duckies" were Nip and Tuck,
who came leaping and dancing up the walk,
wagging and sneezing, with every demonstration
of frantic joy.</p>

<p>"Which is which? Nip, oh, you dear! Give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a paw! Do they know how to give a paw,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"They know how to fetch," said Hugh.
"Here, Tuck! here, boys! What have I
got?"</p>

<p>He held up a stick; straightway the dogs
went mad, and yelled and danced, sneezed and
yapped, like wild creatures. "Fetch!" said
Hugh, throwing the stick. Together the puppies
flashed off in pursuit; fell upon the stick
and each other, and rolled over and over, still
in frenzied voice and motion; finally came to
an understanding, and, taking each an end in
his mouth, came cantering abreast up to Hugh,
and, laying the stick at his feet, looked up and
asked for more, as plainly as ever did Oliver
Twist. Here was a pleasant amusement for young
people. The grave Hugh and the gay Merryweathers,
Peggy and Jean, all became absorbed
in picking up sticks and throwing them. There
was no end to the puppies' enthusiasm, apparently;
they yelled, and rushed, and yelled and
rushed again; and when Margaret came out an
hour afterward, anxious lest her guests should
find time hang heavy on their hands, she found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one and all flushed and breathless, hurling sticks
and stones, and making almost half as much
noise as the dogs themselves. At sight of Margaret,
cool and pearly in her white dress, Gerald
and Peggy dropped their sticks, and looked
abashed; but Hugh called to her merrily:
"Margaret, they are making great progress. I
think my pupil has got farther than yours,
though. Miss Margaret and I are training them
for a prize contest," he added, turning to
Gerald. "This is an extension of their usual
practice, that is all."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Gerald, much relieved. "I
was afraid she would think&mdash;I didn't know
whether she would approve," he concluded,
somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> amazing. It was rather as if the
Venus of Milo had begun to sing light opera,
Gerald thought; but after all, how much pleasanter
if she should, than to stand there all day
and wonder how she was going to eat her breakfast
without any arms. With this shocking
reflection, Master Gerald betook himself once
more to the throwing of sticks, and the sport
went on till Margaret called the puppies off, declaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that they would be too tired for their
afternoon run.</p>

<p>"She takes care of everything, you see!"
said Gerald, aside to his brother. "All without
any fuss; that's just like Hilda, too."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phil. "Appears to be a corker!"</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk so much slang,
Phil!" said Gerald. "What kind of word is
that to use in speaking of Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>Philip looked up in amazement, and saw his
brother flushed, and evidently annoyed in
earnest.</p>

<p>"Well, may I be split and buttered!" said
Phil.</p>

<p>"I wish you were!" said Gerald, forcing a
laugh. "Come along, and don't be an ass!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>GRACE'S SYSTEM</h3>


<p>"Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Peyton."</p>

<p>"Is that door shut? lock it, will you? and&mdash;just
go and look out of the window, please. No
one there? Thank you!"</p>

<p>She sank back on her pillows with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Margaret, soothingly.
"What troubles you, dear Mrs. Peyton?"</p>

<p>"I am frightened!" said Emily Peyton.</p>

<p>"Frightened?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am afraid of that girl, Margaret."</p>

<p>"What girl? You cannot possibly mean
Grace?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton glanced around her. Evidently
she did mean Grace.</p>

<p>"She behaves so!" she said, in a low voice.
"I don't think she is in her right mind, to begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
with; it is terrible to be with a person who
may break out into madness at any moment."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Margaret, "you are absolutely
and wholly mistaken. Grace is as sane
as I am. She is one of the sanest persons I
have ever known, it seems to me. Of course
she is singular&mdash;eccentric, if you like. But
what has she been doing, to disturb you so?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton glanced around her again, with
an apprehensive glance. "Well!" she said,
"I&mdash;I suppose I may as well tell you, Margaret.
I have been ill so long, I may have become&mdash;a
little unreasonable. There is nobody
who cares; I never saw any reason why I should
be reasonable. Having to lie here, it is a pity
if I may not have my own way, don't you think
so? I have had it, at any rate; I don't say
that it has always been a sensible way; I detest
sensible things and people. I can't imagine
how I have endured you so long. I should not,
if you were not pretty and prim."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Margaret, soberly.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me! This has been on my
mind for two weeks, and I want to get rid of
it. There is nobody else I can tell. Doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Flower, like a veritable fiend, after sending me
this firebrand, goes off to Europe. A physician
should be indicted for going to Europe. Well&mdash;I
don't know what to tell you, or where to
begin. She&mdash;she frightens me, I say. I never
know what she is going to do next. Yesterday&mdash;I
felt wretchedly yesterday, Margaret; I was
in acute pain all day. I suppose I was pretty
impatient. I&mdash;well, I threw something out of
the window in a pet,&mdash;my amethyst rope it was,&mdash;and
she stood and looked at me quietly, as if
she were taking notes of my appearance. I
couldn't bear it; I told her to go after it. Just
a little impatient cry, it was. My dear, in an
instant she was out of the window. Gone, out
of sight like a flash. I shrieked; no one heard
me. I&mdash;you will not believe this, Margaret&mdash;I
got out of bed, and dragged myself to the
window, expecting to see her dead and shattered
at the bottom. There she stood, cool as crystal,
shaking the leaves from her dress. She looked
up and saw me, and if ever I saw an elfish look&mdash;do
you believe in witchcraft, Margaret? my
nurse did; she told me some strange tales when
I was a child."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"No need of witchcraft in this case," said
Margaret, smiling. "Grace is as active as a
cat, and her special delight is to climb up and
down walls. There is a grape-vine under this
window, isn't there? That would be quite
enough for the Goat, as they called her at
school."</p>

<p>"That isn't all," said Mrs. Peyton. "She's
not right, I tell you; not canny, as Nurse used
to say. You may laugh, Margaret Montfort. I
tell you, lying here year after year, one gets to
thinking all kinds of things. I could tell you&mdash;who
knows the old woman was not right
after all?&mdash;listen to this. Yesterday, this very
yesterday, she was standing there by the mantel-piece,
talking as quietly as we are talking
now. Suddenly, without a word, down she
falls in a swoon, or trance, or something unearthly.
I had let the maids go out; we two
were alone in the house. There she lay, and I
thought she was dead. I got up again! No
one knows what it cost me, Margaret. I have
forgotten how to walk; I merely dragged myself
across to where she lay. She was breathing;
I could not see that she was paler than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
usual&mdash;she never has any color, you know. I
called and screamed; I raved and wept, I believe;
you cannot fancy how terrible it was, that
living, breathing form, lying there, the lips
almost smiling, but no sign, no twitching of an
eyelid, only the beating of the heart, to tell me
that she was not dead. Hush! do you know
the story of Christy Moran? My nurse's grandmother
used to know her. She was&mdash;I don't
know what she was&mdash;but she used to do this
very thing. They would find her sitting in her
chair, breathing, but without speech or motion,
and afterward they would hear of some devilish
act or other, committed at that very hour, in
some distant town or village, by a figure wearing
her likeness. Don't laugh! don't laugh!
I tell you, we don't know everything in this
civilization that we talk so much about. I
tried to say a prayer, Margaret,&mdash;I used to
say them regularly,&mdash;but&mdash;and I had hardly
begun before she opened her eyes and smiled at
me like a child. 'Did you ever hear of catalepsy?'
she says, and she went out of the room
without another word, and left me to get back
to bed as best I could."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was silent, not knowing what to
say. She had no doubt that Grace was acting
upon some theory of her own, and was playing
these wild pranks in the hope of rousing her
patient to action and exercise. Certainly, to
get Mrs. Peyton out of bed twice in two days
was no small feat; still, Margaret's gentle mind
shrank from the thought of forcing one so frail,
so enfeebled by years of invalidism, into sudden
activity which might be injurious, or even fatal
to her. She could not betray Grace&mdash;what
should she say? But there was no need of her
saying anything, for Mrs. Peyton went on, hurriedly,
hardly glancing at her auditor. Evidently
it was a relief to her to free her mind.</p>

<p>"Why don't I send her away, you may
ask. Margaret, I ask myself the same question
twenty times a day. My dear, she is too
fascinating! She interests me so! Have you
heard her sing, and tell stories? I have not
been so interested for years. She makes me
restless, I tell you; she makes me think of
things I had forgotten, or that I said good-by
to years and years ago. Look! she sits down
on the floor here, beside the bed&mdash;in the night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
often, when I cannot sleep, and she has been
rubbing me&mdash;that is another reason why I do
not let her go, Margaret; her touch is like healing
balm; there is magic in it, I tell you. She
sits down there, with her long hair falling all
about her, in the moonlight, looking like nothing
earthly, and she talks&mdash;or chants, rather,&mdash;there
isn't anything like it, so I don't know
what to call it&mdash;about foreign countries. She
has never seen them, or she says she never has.
That is a little matter to her; she knows all
about them, twenty times as much as I do,
though I used to travel till I hated the sight
of a railway or a steamer. She tells me things
about Sicily, and Norway, and the Hebrides,&mdash;old
Icelandic legends,&mdash;about Burnt Njal, and
those people; she makes me want to see the
places, actually. There are plenty of places I
have not seen. She says Iceland is a flower-garden
in summer. Margaret, don't laugh at
what I am going to say!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not laughing, dear Mrs.
Peyton."</p>

<p>"She says&mdash;this girl says&mdash;she thinks I
could&mdash;get up. Get up and do things, I mean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
like other people. Did you ever hear of such
nonsense?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed; but she looked eagerly
at Margaret, and there was something in her
eyes that had never been there before.</p>

<p>Margaret leaned over her, and kissed the
beautiful forehead. "I am sure you could!"
she said; and at the moment she did feel sure.
Something of Grace's spirit seemed to pass into
her, and she felt a hope, a confidence, that
had never come into her mind before. Why
not? Why should it not be? Mrs. Peyton was
still in middle life; she ought to have years of
life before her. Why might she not be roused,
be taught over again how to live, and to enjoy
the good and glorious earth? Margaret's eyes
kindled.</p>

<p>"I am sure you could!" she repeated. "Let
us try! Let me help Grace, and let us all try
our very best, dear Mrs. Peyton. Just think how
wonderful it would be to get well; to go about
again, and be alive among live people. Oh, my
dear, let us try!"</p>

<p>But the lady's mood changed. In a flash,
even as Margaret was gazing at her with eager,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
loving eyes,&mdash;eyes in which stood tears of affection
and anxiety,&mdash;she changed. The mocking
smile crept back to her lips, the light of
interest died from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Bah!" she said. "Little goose, what do
you know about life and live people? It was
to get away from them that I took to my bed,
do you hear? There, go away! I have been
talking great nonsense; forget all about it!
Sick folks often talk nonsense. Give me something
to play with, and go away! I had a new
toy yesterday, an amber ball. It's in the top
drawer. Ah! isn't that a beauty? Give it to
me! See, how smooth and cool it is, Margaret!
Do you think an amber necklace would be becoming
to me? I can wear yellow, you know;
blondes of my type rarely can, but it always
suited me. Do you remember a story about
the Amber Gods? It is one of the few stories
I ever cared for. To-morrow I'll order a
set of amber jewelry, bracelets and necklace,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, seeing the grave compassion
in Margaret's eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="310" height="400" alt="&quot;SHE LOOKED UP, AND SAW GRACE SITTING ON A BROAD, LOW BRANCH.&quot;" title="&quot;SHE LOOKED UP, AND SAW GRACE SITTING ON A BROAD, LOW BRANCH.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE LOOKED UP, AND SAW GRACE SITTING ON A BROAD, LOW BRANCH.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Don't speak to me!" she cried, angrily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"You are thinking&mdash;I know what you are
thinking&mdash;that I cannot wear necklaces in
bed. You think I am a wretched, helpless,
faded old woman. I hate you! Go away!"
and Margaret went.</p>

<p>As she passed along the garden-walk with
bent head, musing soberly enough, something
struck her lightly on the head,&mdash;a cherry,
which fell at her feet. She looked up, and
saw Grace sitting on a broad, low branch.</p>

<p>"Come up!" said the Goat.</p>

<p>Margaret smiled, and shook her head. "My
dear Grace, I never climbed a tree in my life.
I should not know where to begin."</p>

<p>"Time you learned!" said Grace, gravely.
"There is no knowing when the race will
return to arboreal habits. Come, Margaret, I
want you!"</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated, and was lost. She looked
about, half fearing, half hoping that somebody
was in sight. No! no gardener came with his
watering-can, no boy with his wheelbarrow.
She turned back, to meet once more the compelling
glance, and see the hand stretched out to
help her. How it was accomplished, Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
never knew, but, after a breathless moment, she
found herself seated on the branch, too, clinging
fast to the rugged bark, and not daring to look
below.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Grace, composedly. "See,
now, what good cherries these are! I have permission
from Madame to kill myself with them,
and am doing my best. They are white oxhearts,
the finest cherry that grows!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I daren't let go my hold of the
branch," said poor Margaret; "and my head
is so dizzy. Dear Grace, how shall I ever
get down again? Won't you help me?"</p>

<p>"Not now! Now it is necessary that you
should stay for a space, and learn to accept this,
as other situations. Begin gradually to look
down and about you. Fix your eye on that
apple-tree, the one with the hump-back; then
let your eyes travel slowly, slowly, over the
ground, till they come here, under our feet.
There! you see it is easy. Is the dizziness
gone?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly much better. I think perhaps,
in a little while, I may get used to it, but
I am quite sure I never shall like it. Why do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
you like to climb so, Grace? Why is it more
comfortable to sit in a tree than on a pleasant,
safe seat on the grass?"</p>

<p>Grace shrugged her shoulders. "Who can
say?" she said. "I have always supposed
that the soul of my grandam inhabited a bird.
Shakespeare! And you know I am an owl myself
in regular, if not in good, standing. What
would you? It is my nature. And how do we
find the Patient to-day? Did she tell you that
she left her bed twice yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Grace, it frightens me, all this wild
work. Are you sure what you are doing?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that there is nothing the matter
with this lady. I think she can be brought
back to health by foul means, but not by fair.
I think that in this case the end justifies the
means. <i>Voil&agrave;!</i>"</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her earnestly; she met a
gaze so full, so clear, so brave, that her own
spirit rose to meet it.</p>

<p>Suddenly Grace held out her hand. "Come!"
she said. "Trust me, Margaret! I am not a
hobgoblin, though I may pose as one now and
then. Trust me; and&mdash;by and by&mdash;try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
love me a little, for I loved you before ever I
saw you."</p>

<p>Margaret took the slender hand and pressed
it cordially. "I will trust you!" she said. "I
have doubted, Grace, I confess; doubted and
feared; but now I shall not fear any more.
Only&mdash;oh, my dear, don't frighten her more
than you have to. She really thinks you are&mdash;not
right; and some of the things she told me
were certainly rather terrifying. That trance,
or whatever it was&mdash;well&mdash;what was it,
Grace?"</p>

<p>Grace laughed, a laugh so merry and clear
that the robins left off eating cherries to see
what the sound might be. "What was it?
My child, it was nothing. I fell down, I shut
my eyes&mdash;again, <i>voil&agrave;!</i> Her mind was prepared
for the marvellous, and she found it.
Nothing simpler than that."</p>

<p>"But you said something about&mdash;catalepsy!
the very sound of that word always frightens
me, because of a story I read once. I don't
wonder it frightened Mrs. Peyton."</p>

<p>"I asked her if she had ever heard of it. A
simple question! Apparently she had. Come,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
let us eat cherries, and strive to approximate
the lettuce. Do you feel any green crinkles
in your veins yet? And how is the Innocent to-day?
I love that child."</p>

<p>"Dear Peggy! I left her trying to teach
Tuck to keep a biscuit on his nose while she
counted twenty. When I left, he could not get
beyond ten, when it was devoured with yelps of
joy. But I have no doubt Peggy will succeed
in time; she has plenty of patience, and plenty
of perseverance."</p>

<p>Grace nodded sagely. "Plenty of patience and
plenty of perseverance!" she repeated. "Great
qualities, Margaret. I wonder if I have them.
I am going to find out. Now&mdash;who is the tall
person who is lame, and sits in a summer-house?"</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. "He doesn't sit in a
summer-house all the time," she said. "That is
Peggy's brother, Hugh Montfort. I want you to
know him, Grace; he is so delightful; I know
you will be friends. Come over to tea this evening,
won't you? Mrs. Peyton promised me you
should; you know we have been trying for you
ever since Peggy came. Do come! Uncle John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
is planning something for us; he will not tell
me what, but it is sure to be something delightful.
Promise that you will come; and then you
must really help me get down, my dear, for the
girls will be wondering where I am."</p>

<p>"Your hands here&mdash;so! Let yourself swing
clear&mdash;don't be afraid; hang still&mdash;now drop
easily! There! was that so very dreadful?
Good-by, cool, green, lovely one! I will come
to-night; good-by!"</p>

<p>"What will Rita say," Margaret questioned
herself as she took her way homeward, "when I
write her that I have been climbing cherry-trees,
and getting down from them without a ladder?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIES OF FERNLEY</h3>


<p>"Now, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Now, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Don't be tormenting, sir! You know that
you promised us a new Mystery of Fernley, if
we would all be good. We have been good;
virtue shines from every one of us, doesn't it,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"My eyes are dazzled," replied her cousin.
"Most of it seems to come from the feminine
side of the house, though, I fear. All that the
boys and I have done has been to abstain from
actual crime."</p>

<p>"Oh, cherries!" said Phil.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Up into the tree of cherry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who should climb but little Jerry?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said Mr. Montfort. "What
are cherries for except to eat, I should like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
know? Yes, you have all been good children,
and it is true that I promised&mdash;something.
Sit down now, all of you, and I will tell you
the story of the Lost Casket."</p>

<p>The young people clustered about him, sitting
on the floor, on cushions and footstools, on anything
rather than the prosaic seat of an ordinary
chair. Mr. Montfort looked around on their
bright, eager faces. Margaret sat next him,
his own Margaret, fair and sweet in her white
dress, with the bright, joyous look that had
grown so habitual to her of late. Next to her
was Gerald Merryweather; it struck Mr. Montfort
suddenly that Gerald Merryweather usually
was beside Margaret. Beyond them again,
Peggy and Jean, with Phil between them; Phil,
who as yet preferred his sister Gertrude's society
to that of any girl he had ever seen. At
the other side of the ring, Grace Wolfe, sitting a
little apart, with the curious air of solitariness
that seemed to surround her even in company.
Hugh Montfort was not far off, though, and his
deep brown eyes were gazing at her intently.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," Mr. Montfort began,
and was greeted with a chorus of disappointment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"Oh, Uncle John! You said it was
true."</p>

<p>"Not a fairy story this time, sir, please; give
us the real thing!"</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet, you impetuous creatures?"
asked Uncle John. "It is true, so far
as I know. And if you interrupt me again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will not!"</p>

<p>"Hear us swear!" cried the young people.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, then, some hundred and
fifty years ago, there lived here at Fernley Mr.
Peter Montfort, the great-great-grandfather of
some of you. He was a worthy gentleman,
with a pretty taste for engravings; that Raphael
Morghen print of the Transfiguration, Margaret,
that you are so fond of, is from his collection.
He travelled about Europe a good deal, buying
engravings; that is the only thing I know
about him, except the fact that he married
twice; and on this marrying twice hangs our
story. Listen now, and you shall hear. His
first wife (she was a Miss Rhinefels) died, leaving
him with an only daughter, Christina Montfort.
The only time the name Christina appears,
I believe, in the family annals. At the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of her mother's death Christina was a woman
grown; a handsome person, to judge from her
miniature, and of strong feelings. She kept
house for her father, and expected to do so all
her days, as an early disappointment had disinclined
her for marriage. When, after a couple
of years, her father, being then a man of seventy,
brought home a wife of twenty-five, Christina
was, not unnaturally, incensed. She refused
to speak to the newcomer, shut herself up in her
own apartments, and had a special servant to
wait upon her. This uncomfortable state of
things continued for some time, when she sickened
of some acute distemper, and died in a short
time. She possessed some fine jewels, which she
had inherited from her mother, and she was
heard to say repeatedly that her stepmother
should never lay a finger on one of them. It is
supposed that she, or her servant acting under
her orders, hid the casket containing these
jewels somewhere in this house; at all events,
they were never found after her death, and have
never, it is said, been seen to this day."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John! but has any one looked
for them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Peggy, every one has looked for
them. I cannot tell you how many Montfort
ladies, in all these generations, have fretted
their nerves and worn out their finger-nails,
hunting for this Lost Casket. I specially requested
your Aunt Faith, Margaret, not to
mention it to you or your cousins when you
were here together. I had seen so many vain
searches, and heard of so many heart-burnings,
in connection with it, that I thought it best to
defer the information till&mdash;till later. This,
however, seems a very favorable time. You
are all too sensible, girls, to be unhappy if you
do not find it. To tell the truth, I used to
hunt for it when I was a boy. But you can
have a grand game of hide and seek, with an
object, imaginary or actual, at the end of it;
and I wish you a merry game, young people,
and I return to my conversation with the Sieur
de Montaigne."</p>

<p>He was surrounded in an instant, kissed,
caressed, and thanked till he declared his life
was in danger, and threatened to take up the
hearth-broom in self-defence; finally they
trooped off, to hold a consultation in the hall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="267" height="400" alt="&quot;ON THE SECOND LANDING THEY PAUSED TO SALUTE THE OLD PORTRAITS.&quot;" title="&quot;ON THE SECOND LANDING THEY PAUSED TO SALUTE THE OLD PORTRAITS.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;ON THE SECOND LANDING THEY PAUSED TO SALUTE THE OLD PORTRAITS.&quot;</span>
</div><p>"Shall we divide our forces and go in small
parties?" inquired Hugh, looking at Grace.</p>

<p>"I say we go just as it happens," said Peggy.
"I think that will be much more exciting."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will," said Hugh, becoming resigned,
as he saw Peggy link her arm in Grace's.
"Come on, then, girls and boys! Suppose we
begin with the garret; Margaret has been promising
to show me its wonders ever since I
came."</p>

<p>On the second landing they paused to salute
the old portraits, and Hugh must point out this
or that one that had a familiar look.</p>

<p>"This might be Margaret's self, I always
think, Miss Wolfe; this sweet-faced lady in the
silvery green gown. See! she has the same
clear, quiet, true eyes, and her hair is the same
shade of soft brown. A lovely face."</p>

<p>"Are you looking at the Sea-green Me?"
asked Margaret over his shoulder. "Our dear
Rita liked it, and used to call it her Sea-green
Margaret. But come now and look at the
glorious Regina, who actually has a look of
Rita herself. And I want Grace to see Hugo,
too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>She passed on, and Grace was about to follow,
but Hugh detained her. "Just one moment,"
he said, speaking low. "This is a fine collection,
Miss Wolfe, but I see no portrait of the
Wood-nymph."</p>

<p>"The Wood-nymph?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you not know that a dryad haunts
this garden of Fernley? Sometimes she is not
seen, only heard in the dusk, singing magical
songs, that fill whoever hears them with a
strange feeling akin to madness. But sometimes&mdash;sometimes
she leaves her tree, and
comes out in the moonlight, and&mdash;dances&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. Grace had started, and now
looked up at him with a curious expression, in
which anger, mirth, and fear seemed struggling
for the upper hand. Before she could reply, a
terrific scream rang through the gallery, startling
the whole party. Turning, they saw Jean,
who had run on before the rest in her eagerness
to explore, standing at the farther end
of the corridor, with open mouth and staring
eyes, the very image of terror.</p>

<p>"My dear child," cried Margaret, running
toward her, "what is it? Are you hurt?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Jeanie?" said Peggy, who was
the first to reach her sister, and already had
her in her arms. "Jean, don't gasp so! You
have seen something; is that it? Margaret,
what did I always tell you?"</p>

<p>Jean nodded, still gasping, and clung to
Peggy with eager, trembling hands. "Oh!"
she moaned. "Peggy, save me! take me
away! the closet; oh, the closet!"</p>

<p>"What closet, dear? This one? Why, this
is the broom closet. There is nothing here to
frighten you, Jean."</p>

<p>"The woman!" murmured Jean. "The
dreadful dead woman! Peggy, I saw her eyes,
and her long hair. Oh, I shall die, I know I
shall!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor lamb!" cried Margaret, laughing
in spite of her compassion. She hurried to
the closet and flung the door wide open. "It
is only Mrs. Body!" she said. "Come and look
again, Jean; it is the lay-figure, dear, nothing
else in the world."</p>

<p>"Lay figure?" faltered Jean, still trembling
and hanging back.</p>

<p>"Yes, the model. Grandmother Montfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
used to paint a great deal, and she had this
creature made to stand for the figure. Come
and look at it, dear child."</p>

<p>Gently and persuasively she drew the trembling
girl forward; the others all pressed behind
her.</p>

<p>There on the floor of the closet lay a figure
which might at the first glance have alarmed a
stouter heart than fifteen-year-old Jean's,&mdash;the
figure of a woman, scantily draped in white.
The arms were stretched out stiffly, the face,
with its staring eyeballs, over which fell some
lank wisps of hair, was turned toward the door.
No wonder Jean was terrified.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry!" said Margaret. "The
children, Basil and Susan D., found her in the
garret last winter. They begged to be allowed
to have her for a plaything, so they kept her in
here, and had great fun with her. Her name
is Mrs. Body, but she can take any part, from
Ophelia to Simple Susan. She took tea with us
once, when Uncle John was away, and she behaved
beautifully; so you see you really must
not mind her, Jean, dear."</p>

<p>"It's no wonder she was frightened, though,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
said Gerald. "My right arm cleaves to the
roof of my mouth, even now that I know who
she is. Mrs. Body, my respects to you, ma'am,
and I desire you of less acquaintance."</p>

<p>While they were all laughing over Mrs. Body,
and commenting upon her various points, Gerald
slipped round to Margaret's side.</p>

<p>"Miss Montfort," he said, speaking in a low
tone, "do you remember the roarer?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, Mr. Merryweather. Do you
know, you never showed me the place. You
had to go away the next day, you remember."</p>

<p>"That is just what I was thinking," said
Gerald. "I have never forgotten that burning
moment when Mrs. Cook and I foregathered in
the dark. I was thinking, what if the Lost
Casket should happen to be somewhere about
that place in the wall? and anyhow, it would
be fun to explore it, and I promised to show it
to you, and I like to keep my promises, because
virtue is my only joy. Won't you come with
me now, and let the rest go on? Awfully nice
in the garret, I am sure, but&mdash;won't you come,
please?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," said Margaret, "that would be delightful!
But&mdash;it is quite dark, isn't it? and
they have all the candles."</p>

<p>"All except this," said Gerald, drawing a
slender cylinder from his pocket. "Electric
candle; you have seen them, of course. I
brought it with me, intending some such exploration,
if permitted. I ran up and got it, at
Mr. Montfort's first word of this search. Come!
the down-stairs hall. This way; oh, please,
this way."</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated, looking doubtfully at
him. "I&mdash;don't know if I ought," she
said. "I should like it of all things, if I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think!" said Gerald, hastily. "Great
mistake to think; wastes the tissues awfully.
Action first, thought afterward! aphorism! Or
if you must indulge in the baneful pursuit, think
how much poor Jerry wants you. Poor Jerry!
child of misfortune!"</p>

<p>"Is that the way you get everything you
want?" said Margaret, laughing, as she followed
him half-reluctantly down-stairs.</p>

<p>"One way; there are others. This is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
best, since it procures me your company. See,
now! in this niche here, behind the big picture!"</p>

<p>He passed his hand along a panel; it swung
back, revealing blackness.</p>

<p>Margaret stared. "I never knew that was
a door!" she said. "Mr. Merryweather, do
you know, I think the person who built this
house must have been a smuggler, a magician,
and a detective, all in one."</p>

<p>"Fine combination!" said Gerald. "I should
like to have known the old codg&mdash;I mean
gentleman. No deep mystery here, though,
beyond the secret door. He did love secret
doors, that ancestor of yours. He may have
been an architect, and have thought door-handles
unsightly, as they are. But see!"</p>

<p>They were now standing in a deep recess, and
he waved his candle to and fro. "This would
appear to have been originally used as a kind
of store-room, or drying-room. See those hooks;
probably for hams&mdash;if not for hanging," he
added. "If you prefer tragedy, Miss Montfort,
you shall have it. There is room for ten persons
to hang here, without touching. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
ghastly upturned faces, their blood-stained robes,
glimmering spectral white in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Margaret. "You really
frighten me. Yes, they must be for hams; now
I think of it, I have heard Frances speak of the
drying-closet. This wall is warm; it must be
close against the kitchen chimney."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" exclaimed Gerald. "Here are
steps, Miss Montfort. Stone steps, leading down
to a trap-door. Shall I help you down, or&mdash;no,
I will go alone. When I open the door, a
hollow groan will be heard, and the clank of
iron fetters. Would you rather have me descend
to Hades with a loud squeak, or shall a headless
spectre arise, grinning and&mdash;beg pardon! anatomy
at fault; grinning requires a head. That's
the way! my genius is always checked in its
soaring flight, and pulled back to earth by idiot
facts."</p>

<p>Running on thus, Gerald descended the stone
steps, Margaret following to their top, timidly.
Sure enough, there was a trap-door at the
bottom, with a ring in it; a perfectly orthodox
trap-door, suitable for the Arabian Nights or
anything else. Gerald took hold of the ring,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
prepared for a vigorous pull; then paused, and
looked at his companion. "I hear voices!" he
said. "Hark!"</p>

<p>They listened. A low murmur came up from
below; the voices were muffled, by distance
or intervening substances, and could not be
distinguished.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think we'd better open it?"
said Margaret, who had such a wholesome awe
of the Mysteries of Fernley that she was
prepared for anything in the way of the
marvellous.</p>

<p>"That is what I think!" said Gerald, cheerfully.
"That's what it was made for, you see.
A door that does not fulfil its destiny might just
as well be something else, skittles, or a pump,
or&mdash;other things. Now this&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he gave a vigorous pull; the
door lifted, but at the same instant the candle
slipped from his hand, and fell rattling into
some unseen depth below, leaving them in
blank darkness. Margaret uttered a cry of
alarm. "Don't fall! Oh, pray be careful,
Mr. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>"All right!" said Gerald. "Stay just where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
you are, for a moment, while I explore this&mdash;aperture.
Ha! the steps continue. You don't
mind if I leave you in the dark for just a
minute, Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>Margaret did not mind, once assured that her
companion was not engaged in the congenial
pursuit of breaking his neck. She began feeling
about her in the darkness, darkness so
thick it was like black velvet, she said to
herself. She found the wall; it was warm,
as she said; she began passing her hand mechanically
along the bricks, counting them.</p>

<p>A cheerful voice came up from below: "I
have found the doughnuts&mdash;good ones!&mdash;and
the&mdash;seem to be&mdash;yes! sweet pickles. Corking!
And&mdash;now you've done it, my son! Jam,
by all that's adhesive! Put my whole hand in.
Jerusalem and Mad&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this instant there was a sound as of a door
thrown violently open; a flood of light filled
the place; light, and an angry voice.</p>

<p>"Who's this here in my pantry? Come out
of that, ye rascal, before I set the dogs on
ye!"</p>

<p>Gerald Merryweather uttered a yell of delight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
"Destiny!" he shouted. "My fate
cries out. Quits, Mrs. Cook, quits! Come to
my arms!"</p>

<p>And Margaret, peeping fearfully down
through the trap-door, beheld her guest waving
one hand, a crimson one, in the air, and
with the other embracing the ample form of
Frances the cook; while behind them the grave
Elizabeth looked wide-eyed, shading her candle
with her hand.</p>

<p>"For shame, sir!" said Frances. "Do behave,
now, Mr. Gerald! I never see such a bold boy
since born I was."</p>

<p>"No, no! not bold; don't say bold, Mrs.
Cook! Witness my blushing eyes, my tearful
cheek, my stammering nose! Hush, listen,
there's a good soul. Your doughnuts are food
for the gods; also for Jerry. Poor Jerry; never
had enough doughnuts in his life. You weep
for him; let him dry the starting tear!"</p>

<p>Drawing out his pocket-handkerchief, he
gravely applied it to Frances's eyes and went
on. "We are looking for the Lost Casket,
Miss Montfort and I. If you can help us to it,
Mrs. Cook,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'll dress thee all in pongo silk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And crown thee with a bowl of milk;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And hail thee, till my last breath passes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The queen of sugar and molasses.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>A poet, as you observe. Nothing to what I
can do, give me time and a yard measure. Now
tell me&mdash;"</div>

<p>Margaret's voice from above interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merryweather, there is a loose brick
here. I can pull it quite out; and&mdash;yes&mdash;there
is a space behind it, and&mdash;oh, can you
bring the light?"</p>

<p>To snatch the lamp from Frances's hand, blow
her a kiss, and scramble up the steps again, was
the work of an instant with Gerald. He found
Margaret pale, with shining eyes, holding something
in her hands.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Gerald. "I say, you haven't&mdash;you
have! eccentric Jiminy, you have found
it!"</p>

<p>"I think I have!" said Margaret, who was
fairly trembling with excitement. "Look! the
letters on the lid! oh, Mr. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>The object she held was a box some eight
inches square, of ebony or some other dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
wood, banded with silver. On the lid were inlaid,
also in silver, the letters C. M.</p>

<p>"Christina Montfort!" said Margaret. "Oh,
to think of my being the one to find it!"</p>

<p>"I should like to know who else had the right
to find it!" said Gerald. "Punch their&mdash;I
mean, of course, if they were fellows; I beg
your pardon, Miss Montfort."</p>

<p>"It is locked," said Margaret. "We must
wait, and try some of Uncle John's keys."</p>

<p>"Take care!" exclaimed Gerald. "The bottom
is dropping out. Hold your hand under it!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the bottom of the box, which
was of some soft wood and had rotted through,
dropped, and something rolled out and fell into
Margaret's hand. She held it up to the light.
It was a hawk's egg, neatly blown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE EGG OF COLUMBUS</h3>


<p>"Why, yes!" said Mr. Montfort. "It is my
egg, certainly."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you know all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell am what&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort put his hands resolutely over
his ears, and shut his eyes. "When you are
still," he said, "I will tell you all about it; till
then I am a blind deaf-mute, with no benefit of
modern instruction."</p>

<p>A swift rustle, followed by dead silence.
Cautiously opening his eyes, Mr. Montfort saw
the whole company seated on the floor around his
chair, gazing at him with imploring eyes, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
motionless and mute. He laughed heartily, and
threw himself back in his chair.</p>

<p>"I promised you a merry game," he said.
"Have you had it?"</p>

<p>The young people nodded like mandarins,
but uttered no sound.</p>

<p>"I promised you nothing more. In fact, I
warned you not to expect anything more. On
your own heads be egg and emptiness.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he added, "since you are so
good and dutiful, you shall have the whole
truth. I found the box some forty years ago,
when I first stumbled on that closet. My dear
mother was timid, and had a great dread of the
Mysteries of Fernley, imagining a secret staircase
in every wall, and an oubliette under every
floor. Somebody had frightened her when she
came here as a child, by showing her I forget
what dark passage or closet. So we were
never officially told of the various pleasant
places devised by the eccentric old ancestor,
Peter, who, I have always believed, was a
smuggler before he was a patriot, and hid kegs
as well as commanders in his smoke-closet. You
know the story of General Blankley and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
hams, Hugh? Remind me to tell you some
day. Well, this being so, of course we youngsters
were keen set on discovery; and we
formed a league, called the Hovering Hawks.
Each of us had his private totem or sign; and
when he made a discovery, he left a totem to
tell that he had been there. Jim's was an
oyster-shell, because he considered the world his
oyster; Dick's was a ship, because he always
meant to be a sailor; Roger's was a book, of
course, for obvious reasons; and mine was an
egg, Columbus's egg, because I meant to find
things out. You see there was no overstock of
modesty among us, more than there is among
most healthy boys. We were ready for anything
and everything. I dare say some of you
may have found oyster-shells about, in various
inaccessible places?"</p>

<p>Grace started, and blushed; then hung her
head. "I&mdash;I found one," she admitted. "It
was in a cubbyhole in the parapet of the roof.
I thought of bringing it away, but it seemed as
if some one had wanted to leave it there, so I
didn't touch it."</p>

<p>"Jim's Retreat," said Mr. Montfort. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stayed up there two days once, in a fit of sulks,
and frightened my poor dear mother almost into
an illness. Father Montfort was away from
home the first day; the second day he came
home, and went up after Master James. He was
a powerful man, Father Montfort, and an excellent
climber. Yes, poor old Jim! he did not
climb again for several days. Well, as I was
saying, after all this very egotistical digression,
I found the box in question some forty years
ago. I withdrew the&mdash;a&mdash;contents&mdash;and
substituted for them my totem. The contents
I put&mdash;elsewhere."</p>

<p>He looked round the circle, smiling. Margaret,
gazing earnestly at him, saw his face, for
the second time since she had known him,
change from that of a grave, thoughtful man
into that of a mischievous boy, the eager eyes
alight with fun, the lips twitching with laughter.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't&mdash;you&mdash;like&mdash;to&mdash;know?" he
began slowly, his eyes turning from one to the
other. Suddenly he broke off.</p>

<p>"There! the play is over, children. Margaret,
you found the casket, you shall find the&mdash;run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
your hand along the back of my chair
here, my dear; where it feels cold, press downward."</p>

<p>Margaret obeyed. A long narrow box or
drawer shot out from the rolling back of the
great mahogany chair. Obeying Mr. Montfort's
gesture, Margaret lifted out of the nest of silky
cotton something that sparkled and glittered in
the firelight. There was a long-drawn sigh
from the girls, a grunt of surprise from the
men, but still no one spoke.</p>

<p>"The pearls are for you, Margaret. I always
meant them for you, my dear. I have taken
them out every birthday and Christmas and
looked at them, but there was always something
else I wanted to give you just then, so I put
the pretty playthings back again. Peggy, these
pink topazes were made expressly for you, even
if they have been waiting some time. No earrings,
thank heaven! I could not see my girls
in earrings. The diamonds I sent to Rita as
a wedding present; you remember them, Margaret.
Deceitful, was I, not to tell you their history?
My child, I said they were family jewels,
and so they were. The turquoises must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Jean's; put them on at once, little girl! Very
pretty; very becoming. Now,&mdash;any more? It
seems to me I remember one more article&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Margaret drew out a long, delicate, glittering
chain. At sight of it, Grace uttered a low cry
of delight. "What is it?" she said. "I never
saw anything so beautiful. Water and moonlight?
What are the stones, Mr. Montfort,
please?"</p>

<p>"Aquamarine," said Mr. Montfort. "They
are beautiful, though not of great value. Now
what shall I do with this last trinket, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>"There is only one person who can possibly
wear it," said Hugh, under his breath. His
uncle heard him, and shot a keen, quizzical
glance at him, which caused the philosopher
to retire suddenly behind the shadow of the
curtain. Margaret glided to her uncle's side,
and whispered in his ear. Mr. Montfort
nodded, smiling. "Just what I was thinking,
Margaret," he said. "You read my thoughts
accurately. My dear Miss Grace&mdash;by the way,
isn't it time for me to leave off the 'Miss,' considering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
my age, and how well we know each
other? 'Miss Grace' suggests 'disgrace,' which
can have no possible connection with you. My
dear Grace, then, as Margaret and others have
said, there is only one person present who ought
to wear this chain, and that person is yourself.
Will you accept it as a little gift from Margaret
and me, and from Cousin Christina?"</p>

<p>Grace drew back, her eyebrows coming together
in a look Peggy knew well. "I&mdash;You
must excuse me," she began; but Mr. Montfort,
going to her, took her hand kindly: "My
child, do not refuse me this little pleasure.
You surely do not expect me to wear the chain
myself? and Margaret has more trumpery than
is good for her already. Besides, as I said, the
thing was manifestly made for you, and for you
alone. And, besides, again, Grace,"&mdash;he drew
her nearer, and spoke low,&mdash;"besides, again,
you are an explorer, too; if you had lived
twenty-five years ago, we should have had great
excursions together. Take it, my dear, if for
no other reason, because it is the gift of the
boy who put the egg in the box!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>IN THE TWILIGHT</h3>


<p>"How strange it seems without the boys!"
said Jean.</p>

<p>"And Uncle John!" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"And Hugh!" said Peggy. "I wish they
hadn't gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't, Peggy!" said Margaret.
"It was such a great chance, to have the day
on that wonderful yacht. Just think what a
good time they are having! I only wish you
could have gone too, but it is a bachelor party,
you see."</p>

<p>"Of course! Oh, I want them to have the
fun, and it was very good of Captain Storm to
let Uncle John take them all. Yes, they will
have a glorious time; only&mdash;well, we miss
them so horribly. Dear me, Margaret, isn't it
strange that you should get to know people so
well in such a short time? Why, I seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
know Gerald and Phil as well&mdash;better, in some
ways, than I know Hugh. But then, I never
feel as if I understood Hugh, he is so&mdash;he
knows so much. Margaret, dear, it makes me
happy all through to have you and Hugh know
each other, and be such friends."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it cannot make you so happy as it
does me, Peggy," said Margaret, smiling. "He
is a wonderful person, that brother of yours.
Yes, he does know a most amazing amount, but
he never makes one uncomfortable with his
knowledge, as some clever people do. He is
like a delightful book, that you can read when
you want to, and when you don't it stays quiet
on its shelf. When I want to know about anything,
and Uncle John is somewhere else, or is
busy, I just turn over a page of Hugh, and
there I have it. Oh, by the bye, Grace, what
was that stanza he was quoting to you this
morning, just before he went away? Don't
you remember? we were coming through the
orchard, he and I, and we met you, and he said
this. I have been trying all day to recall it."</p>

<p>"Keats!" said Grace, briefly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that; it was from 'La Belle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Dame sans Merci,' but I cannot get the whole
stanza. Won't you repeat it? I know you
have almost the whole of Keats by heart."</p>

<p>Grace hesitated, and murmured something
about "a time for everything," but finally, half-reluctantly,
she repeated the stanza:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'I met a lady in the meads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Full beautiful, a fairy's child;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her hair was long, her foot was light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And her eyes were wild.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret. "Well&mdash;thank you,
Grace! I just wanted to hear it in your voice;
what I was thinking of was, that Hugh always
knows just what to say about everything and
everybody. He has the whole Golden Treasury
in his head, and he always turns the right page.
Do you remember the other day, when Michael
was so stupid!"</p>

<p>"Michael is always stupid!" said Jean.</p>

<p>"Poor Michael! He is not very clever."
(Michael was the stable-boy at Fernley, a new
importation from Ireland, with a good deal of
peat-bog still sticking to his brains.) "Well,
the other day he was more stupid than usual,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
for he was sent in town to get some rolled oats
that Frances wanted. Well, he brought back
just plain oats; and when Frances wanted to
know what he meant by that, he said, 'Sure,
it's meself can rowl 'em about for yez, as well
as that feller in the white jacket.' Frances
explained the situation to him with more force
than amiability. She was in a perfect storm,
and poor Michael stood meekly, feeling of his
ear as if she had actually boxed it, though really
she only threatened to, and wondering what it
was all about. Well, Hugh and I came along,
and Hugh just looked at him, and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The ass upon the pivot of his skull<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Turned round a long left ear!'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>There is no other quotation in the English
language that would have fitted the case so
perfectly."</div>

<p>"You and Grace seem to know Hugh about a
hundred times as well as Peggy and I do," said
Jean, pouting a little.</p>

<p>"Because they are clever, my dear, and we
are not," said Peggy, cheerfully. "If you would
learn things, Jean, English literature and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that, you might be able to talk to Hugh. As
it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I think Phil and Gerald are ever so
much more fun, anyhow!" said Jean, saucily.
"Hugh is poky!"</p>

<p>Seeing an elder-sisterly cloud gathering on
Peggy's brow, Margaret hastened to interfere.
"Girls," she said, "I have a confession to make.
I was just going to make it, when the quotations
turned me off the track. You know what
Peggy was saying, about our all getting to know
each other so well from staying in the house
together. That reminded me of something,
something I am very much ashamed of; and
I think it would be good for my soul to confess
it. But you must promise never to tell."</p>

<p>"We promise! We promise!" cried all the
girls.</p>

<p>"Margaret," said Grace, "I have been looking
for your sins ever since I came, but you
were too clever for me; now I shall learn."</p>

<p>"Not my fault," said Margaret, merrily, "if
you are a bat as well as a dozen other animals,
my dear. Well, girls&mdash;oh, I am ashamed, and
it really is most astonishingly virtuous of me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
tell you about it. Peggy, just before you came,
I was very blue; deeply, darkly, most unbeautifully
blue!"</p>

<p>"Margaret! you, blue?"</p>

<p>"Hear Peggy making rhymes! Yes, I, blue.
You see, the children were gone, and I did miss
them so, I hardly knew how to bear it. It is
impossible for any one to have any idea, girls,
how children, children that are little enough to
need one's care, you know, and&mdash;and watching,
and thinking about, and all&mdash;how they get
inside your heart and just live there, all curled
up in it, bless them! and these particular children
are the very dearest ones that ever lived, I
do believe. Well, so they were gone, and my
heart seemed empty; wickedly and abominably
empty, for there was my own dearest uncle, and
there were you, my own Peggy, coming to spend
the whole summer with me, and as if that were
not joy enough for three people, let alone one,
I made all kinds of plans, about studying, and
teaching you housekeeping, and embroidery, and
all kinds of things. We were going to read
so many hours a day, and work so many hours,&mdash;my
poor Peggy! you would have had an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
unmerciful kind of time!&mdash;and everything was
going to be quiet and regular and cheerful; I
never got beyond cheerfulness in my brightest
dreams of the summer. But even the cheerfulness
was far ahead, and just then&mdash;before you
came&mdash;I really had difficulty sometimes in
keeping a cheerful face for Uncle John when
he came in. Why&mdash;must I tell the whole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Margaret, every word!"</p>

<p>"I used to go up to Susan D.'s room and cry
over her little pinafores and things. As for my
pincushion, I fairly soaked it with tears when
I first found it. I told you about the pincushion,
didn't I? Why, that little lamb, for
days before she went, was working away at
something, she would not let me see what.
After she was gone, I went up to my room
for a quiet cry, and there was a gorgeous new
pincushion, and 'I love you,' on it in pins. My
dear little girl! Well, girls, so&mdash;that was the
way I felt, and the way I acted, most absurdly;
and then&mdash;all this happened. First Hugh
dropped from the skies; and then Uncle proposed
the house party, and you came, Jean,
and the Merryweathers; and then you, Peggy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and we discovered our dear Grace; and so,
instead of a quiet, rather humdrum summer,
I am having the most enchanting, Arabian-nights
kind of time that ever was. And how
do you think I feel?"</p>

<p>"Phil would say 'like thirty cents!'" said
Jean, who was certainly a little inclined to be
pert.</p>

<p>"If I hear you say anything of the kind,
young one, I'll swat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peggy, dearest!" murmured Margaret,
softly.</p>

<p>"I'll speak to you very severely. I am
ashamed of you, Kidderminster!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Peggy, I won't stand that!"
said Jean. "You promised me, when I first
came, that you wouldn't call me that."</p>

<p>"Then don't behave like a kid!" retorted
Peggy. "There, that's enough. Yes, Margaret,
it has all been perfectly delightful and fairy-like;
and then the Mysteries, too, and the
hunting, and the Silver Closet, and all. Oh,
I am so glad we didn't find out everything that
first summer. I suppose Uncle John thought
we were too young and silly then; not that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
you were ever silly, you dear darling thing.
But, Margaret, there is one thing wanting to
it all, and only you and I know what that is."</p>

<p>Margaret nodded. "Yes," she said, with
a little sigh. "We want our Princess, Peggy.
Oh, Grace, if you only knew our Rita! How
you and she would love each other! Peggy,
you said that just at the right moment, for
I have her last letter in my pocket, on purpose
to read to you, and I am sure the others would
like to hear it, too. Would you, girls?"</p>

<p>There seemed no possible doubt on the subject.
All the girls gathered about Margaret,
sitting on the floor, as they liked best to do.
Margaret herself took possession of her favorite
low chair, and drawing the letter from her
pocket, began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Beloved Marguerite</span>:&mdash;I am of return only yesterday
from an expedition to the hills, and I find your
precious letter waiting for me. No need to tell you
that I pressed it to my heart, covered it with kisses.
Jack says your letters are the sole thing of which he is
jealous. I grieve to hear that you must lose those little
ones whom you love so well, even for a short time; but
courage, <i>Margarita mia;</i> there are other flowers besides
roses, and summer is a pleasant time. You will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Peggy with you, dear Peggy! She sends me a photograph,
which shows her little changed in the face; still
the dimples, still the soft roundness of cheek and chin.
Best of Peggys; if I had her here, what great joy!
But I must tell you of our ride. We went, Jack and
I, up to the hill camp, where we went last year, after
the terrible ride you know of. There we spent three
happy days, camping in the green hollow among the
hills, with only Juan to cook for us and care for
the horses. Ah, Marguerite, what a time was that!
We visited every spot made sacred to us by our love.
The hiding-place, near poor Don Annunzio's house,
where I first saw my hero, swinging in his hammock.
Have I told you that I thought him a skulker, a coward
hiding to escape warfare? How often we have laughed
over that! Then we passed along the road, so peaceful
now, so wild and horrent then (how is this word, 'horrent,'
Marguerite? I find it in a poem, it seems to me
noble; I tell Jack, he laughs, and says something like
'high falu&mdash;' I cannot tell what!). We paused to weep
over the gray heap where once smiled the <i>residencia</i>,
where that kind old woman and her good vast husband
sheltered the wandering maiden, protected her at the
risk of their own lives, and&mdash;one of them, as you know&mdash;died
to save her and others. Then farther, to Carlos's
old camp, where Manuela and I lived, and where I first
learned to be of a little use in the world. Ah, the memories,
how they came crowding back! I have told you
that Manuela is married to Pepe? Yes; two months
ago. The wedding was charming! I gave her her
wedding-gown, of finest muslin, suitable to her condition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with plenty of lace and ribbons, which the poor
child values highly, and I dressed her hair (poor Manuela!
She would have done it far better herself; she
has a wonderful gift. My present maid is a poor creature,
but Manuela is to give her lessons), and arranged
the veil and wreath. She was a vision of enchantment,
and really thrown away on poor Pepe, who never looked
at either dress or veil. Jack says 'neither did he.'
My dear, these men! To what purpose do we adorn
ourselves, exhaust the treasure of our souls, in efforts to
please them? But I wander from my story. My child,
this expedition, carrying back heart as well as body to
the scenes of before our marriage, has told me over again
the story of my happiness. Marguerite, how to deserve
it, this wonderful bliss? I study, I try, the dear Saint
teaches me always many things&mdash;in vain! I am debtor
to the whole world, and how much more to the gracious
Power above worlds! But enough of this, my Pearl!
Your time will come; till then you know nothing of it.
I pant for your awakening, I burn, Marguerite, but I am
powerless. If I had you here, there is a friend of ours,
a paladin, a Roland, second only to my Jack&mdash;no! This
makes you laugh, I feel it, I see your cool, pearly smile.
I am angry with you for laughing, yet I laugh, too. So!
now of other things. I think of you always; Jack also;
I have told him so much, he assassinates himself with
desire to see you all. The time will come! Marguerite&mdash;no
matter! One word only! Our beloved Uncle's
birthday; I remember the day, the Fourteenth. You
will honor it, I know, as such a day should be honored,
the day which blessed the earth with the best man&mdash;except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
one&mdash;that breathes mortal breath. Marguerite,
if on that day a trifle should come from the far-away
cousins, you will receive it kindly? Ah, how well I
know the answer! Bless you, my treasure! I must
go to my housekeeping. Dear Donito Miguelito is staying
with us now; you can fancy the joy of tending this
saintly old man in his feebleness. I prepare myself the
little dishes that please him; it is a sacred task; it is
like feeding a holy butterfly.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">"Adios, my Marguerite!</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Ever and ever your devoted</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Rita</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>"You ask of Concepcion. She is married to Diego
Moreno, and, as I hear, is very unhappy. Poor woman,
I compassionate her!"</p></div>

<p>After the reading of the letter, Grace slipped
away to return to her patient, and the three
cousins sat together, talking in low tones of Rita,
and of Grace herself. Jean maintained stoutly
that Rita could not be so fascinating as Grace.
Peggy and Margaret insisted that, though
totally different in quality, neither could outdo
the other in amount of charm.</p>

<p>"They are both the kind of girls you would
do anything for!" said Peggy; "just anything
in the world, no matter how foolish, just because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they wanted you to. It isn't a thing you can
describe; it just <i>is</i>, and nobody can help it."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think the difference would
be in the kind of thing they would ask you to
do," said Jean, with wisdom beyond her years.
"Grace wouldn't ask you anything foolish, and
I should think Cousin Rita might."</p>

<p>"Grace!" exclaimed Peggy; and then
checked herself loyally. "Grace wasn't always
so wise as she is now, young one!" she said,
simply.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a dear, anyhow; I think Mrs.
Peyton might have let her stay all night. It's
horribly poky, with Uncle John and the boys
and everybody away. Why, Margaret, there
isn't a single man about the place, is there?
Bannan drove them over, and then he was going
to the cattle-show, and so was Michael. Suppose
there should be robbers, or anything!"</p>

<p>"Suppose there should!" said Peggy, coolly.
"If Frances and I and the dogs could not
arrange matters with a robber, it would be a
pity. Margaret&mdash;what is this queer light?
Has everything turned red, all of a sudden?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

<span class="caption">&quot;A TALL, SLENDER FIGURE HALF RAN, HALF TOTTERED INTO THE ROOM.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"The moon rises late to-night," said Margaret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>"I have no idea what time it is now.
It seems an hour since Grace went."</p>

<p>"The moon isn't red, anyhow!" said Peggy.
"I believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she rose and went to the
window. "Girls!" she cried. "There is a fire
somewhere near. Come and look!"</p>

<p>Margaret and Jean pressed hastily forward to
the window. It was a strange scene on which
they looked. All of a sudden, the world seemed
turned to red and black. A crimson light suffused
the sky; against it the trees stood black
as ebony. Even as they looked, a crest of flame
sprang up above the tree-tops, wavered, and
broke into a shower of sparks; at the same instant
their nostrils were filled with the acrid,
pungent smell of wood smoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it? Where can it be?" cried
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's only a bonfire!" said Jean.</p>

<p>Peggy shook her head. "Too big for a bonfire!"
she said. "I'll go out and see, Margaret.
What a pity the boys should miss it! I'll come
back and let you know&mdash;mercy! what's this?"</p>

<p>The door opened, and a tall, slender figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
half ran, half tottered into the room. "Margaret!"
cried a wild voice of terror. "Margaret
Montfort, save me!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Mrs. Peyton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Emily Peyton. My house is burning.
I ran all the way here. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Margaret and Peggy caught her as she fell
forward, and laid her on the sofa, and while
Jean ran for water and Elizabeth, chafed her
hands and her temples, looking the while
anxiously at each other.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us what happened?" asked
Margaret, trying to keep her voice quiet and
even, for Mrs. Peyton was in the wildest agitation.
"You escaped, thank Heaven! but&mdash;is
the fire serious? Who is there now? Where is
Grace Wolfe?"</p>

<p>"Don't leave me!" said the sick woman, with
a ghastly look. "Margaret, if you leave me I
shall die. She&mdash;she went back for the jewels.
She is in the house now."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRE</h3>


<p>The three girls reached the door in the same
instant, but Mrs. Peyton followed, and still held
Margaret's arm in a desperate clutch.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me!" she repeated. "Margaret,
don't leave me to die!"</p>

<p>But Margaret put the clinging hands away.
"You are not going to die," she said. "You
are going to sit down in this chair, Mrs. Peyton,
and be quiet till I come back. See, here
is Elizabeth, with water and cologne, and everything
comfortable. By and by you shall go
up-stairs, but rest here now; nothing can happen
to you, and I will come back as soon as I can."</p>

<p>Wondering at her own hardihood, Margaret
ran out, shunning the wild pleading of the beautiful
eyes which she knew were bent upon her.
Jean was waiting for her on the step, but Peggy
had disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said we were to go on," said Jean,
"and she would catch us up. Which way,
Margaret? I don't know the way."</p>

<p>Margaret led the way through the garden,
running as she had never run before. They
had not gone a hundred yards when Peggy was
at their side. She had a coil of rope slung
over her arm.</p>

<p>"It may be wanted," she said. "I remembered
where it always hung. Oh, if the boys
were only here!"</p>

<p>They ran on in silence, Margaret echoing the
cry in her heart. At every step the glare grew
brighter, the rolling smoke thicker. Margaret
noticed, and wondered at herself for noticing,
that the under side of some of the leaves above
her head shone red like copper, while others
were yellow as gold. Every patch of fern and
brake, every leaf of box or holly, stood out, clear
as at noonday.</p>

<p>On, down the long cedar alley, the dew dripping
from the branches as they closed behind
them; over the sunk fence, and across the
lower garden to the summer-house, Hugh's
summer-house. Once Margaret would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
shuddered at the drop into the meadow below,
but Grace's climbing lessons had not been given
in vain, and, without a moment's hesitation, she
followed Peggy down the old willow-tree, landing
knee-deep in fern below.</p>

<p>Now they could hear the roar of the flames,
the crackling and snapping of burning wood,
and, looking up, they saw on the brow of the
rise beyond, the flames tossing and beckoning
over the dark firs of Silverfield.</p>

<p>Five minutes more, and, breathless with
running, they stood on the lawn before the
burning house.</p>

<p>The side facing them was already wrapped in
flames. Long wavering tongues shot through
the open windows, and curled round the woodwork,
lapping it; they purred and chuckled like
live creatures over their food; they leaped up
toward the roof, running along its edge, feeling
their way higher and higher, while now and
then one sprang aloft, tossing its scarlet crest
over the rooftree itself. Evidently the fire had
started in the upper story, for in the lower one,
though the smoke poured dense and black
through the open windows, there were no flames<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to be seen yet. Furniture, books, and knick-knacks
of every description were scattered about
the lawn in wild confusion, and two men, half
stifled with smoke, were struggling frantically
with a grand piano, one hacking at the window-frame
with an axe to widen the opening, the
other trying desperately to unscrew the legs, as
if that would mend matters. Seven people out
of ten, at a fire, will leave untouched pictures
and books that can never be replaced, and spend
their time and energies in trying to save the
piano.</p>

<p>The group of frightened women huddled together
on the lawn had made their attempt, too,
to save some of their mistress's property. Even
in her terror and anguish, Margaret could hardly
keep back the thought of a smile at their aspect.
One clasped a sofa-pillow, one a pair of
vases. A stout woman, evidently the cook, had
a porcelain kettle on either arm, and another on
her head, while her hands clutched a variety of
spoons, ladles, cups, and dippers. She evidently
had her wits about her more than the others,
and she was scolding the parlor-maid, a trembling,
weeping creature, who was holding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
small china bowl in both hands, as if it were
a royal treasure.</p>

<p>"She likes her malted milk in it, you know
she does, Mary," said the girl. "Only yesterday
she was telling me never bring her any
bowl except this. It's cruel of you to harry me
for trying to save what she likes."</p>

<p>"You green goose! What will she want wid
the bowl and you not leaving her a spoon to
sup wid! Where is the key of the safe, I'm
askin' ye! Maybe James could get it out
yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know! I don't know! I expect
I dropped it. I was going to get the silver
myself; I'd ha' got all of it, without you telling
me, but when I opened the pantry door, the
fire leapt out at me, roaring like the pit, and I
dropped the key and run. I'm awful sorry, but
I've got the bowl, and I do wish you'd let me
be."</p>

<p>A little apart stood Antonia, the French maid,
bearing on her outstretched arms a superb tea-gown
of violet velvet, embroidered with pearls.
On it lay a pile of costly laces, slightly blackened
by smoke, but uninjured. Antonia had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
done her best, and had saved the treasure of
her heart. Margaret ran up to her.</p>

<p>"Antonia, where is Miss Wolfe?"</p>

<p>The woman did not seem to hear the question,
but burst into agitated speech. "Oh, mademoiselle,
mademoiselle!" she cried. "Ah, the
tragedy! of all the robes arrived from Paris
last week, but only last week, this only remaining!
It was all I could save, all! I tried;
I burned myself the hands, mademoiselle, to
rescue the others, the blue crape, the adorable
lace <i>jacquettes</i>, the <i>satin rose-th&egrave;</i>&mdash;in vain,
all gone, all devoured! <i>Mon Dieu</i>, and madame
had not even had them on! But the lace,
Mademoiselle Montfort, the point d'Alen&ccedil;on, the
Valenciennes, all, I have it safe. See, mademoiselle,
regard for yourself, <i>un peu noirci</i>, a leetle
blackened, <i>voil&agrave; tout!</i> It is without price, the
point d'Alen&ccedil;on, you know, Mademoiselle Marguerite."</p>

<p>"Antonia, do you hear me? What do I care
about the laces? Where is Miss Wolfe?"</p>

<p>"She's mazed, miss!" said Mary, the cook.
"She can't talk about nothin' but that stuff.
Sure Miss Wolfe is at Fernley wid the mistress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
It's wondher ye didn't meet them on the
way, miss. She went wid Mrs. Peyton, and me
and the other girls stopped behind to see what
we could save."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Margaret. "Mrs. Peyton
came alone. She said Miss Wolfe came back&mdash;for
the jewels. She said she was in the house
now."</p>

<p>"Lord help her then!" said the parlor-maid.
"If she's in the house now, she's as good as
dead, and worse, too. The stairs has fallen in;
Thomas seen 'em fall. Oh, dear! oh, dear! what
an awful time!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Eliza!" said the cook. "Where's
Jenny? She was in the sewing-room, next to
Miss Wolfe's; maybe she'd know something.
Who saw Jenny since we come out? Good
Lord, where is the child? I thought she come
with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jenny's all right!" moaned Eliza.
"She'll have gone straight home. She was
going home to spend the night anyway, Mary;
don't be scaring us worse. It's bad enough to
lose Miss Wolfe, poor young lady, and she so
bold and daring!"</p>

<p>"<i>Hold your tongue!</i>" said Peggy. "Listen
to me, girls, and answer plainly, and not all at
once like a flock of foolish sheep. Did any one
see Miss Wolfe go into the house?"</p>

<p>"No, miss, no; we see her go with Mrs.
Peyton, and we never thought but she was all
right."</p>

<p>"She may not be there after all!" said
Peggy. "Her room is on the other side, isn't
it, Margaret? Come on!"</p>

<p>They ran round to the other side of the
house. This was apparently still untouched,
though the fiery tongues came darting over the
rooftree every now and then, hissing and lapping,
and the roof itself was covered with
sparks and great patches of burning tinder,
fragments of the costly stuffs and tissues that
the house-owner had so dearly prized. The
windows were closed and silent, but all was
bright as day in the red glare of the fire.</p>

<p>"Call, Peggy!" whispered Margaret. "I
have no voice."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, a window in the second
story was thrown up, and there stood Grace
herself, very pale, but quiet as usual.</p>

<p>"There's a young woman faint here," she
said. "Too much smoke. The stairs are gone.
Is there a ladder, Peggy? Ah, rope! Much
better. Clever child! When I say three&mdash;throw!"</p>

<p>Oh, the good days on the Western farm, when
little Peggy, on her rough pony, scampered here
and there, lassoing the sheep and calves, and
getting well scolded in consequence! Oh, the
other good days at school, where nerve and
muscle learned to follow the quick eye, so that
thought and action seemed to flash together!</p>

<p>The rope hissed upward like a flying snake,
but a cloud of smoke drove past the window, and
the outstretched hands missed it. Again it flew,
and this time it was caught, drawn up, and
knotted tight inside the window.</p>

<p>"Now if I had a ladder!" muttered Peggy.</p>

<p>"I saw one," cried Margaret; "I am sure
I did. Wait!"</p>

<p>She flew off, and returned followed by a
boy with a ladder. It proved short by several
feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do!" cried Margaret.</p>

<p>"Hold the ladder steady!" said Peggy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"She'll see to that end, and I can manage
this. Hold it!"</p>

<p>Margaret and the boy grasped the ladder;
Peggy ran up it, and stood on the top rung,
holding the lower end of the rope.</p>

<p>"All ready, Goat!" she called.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" said the quiet voice within.
"Coming, Innocent!"</p>

<p>The women had followed Margaret and
Peggy, and now a cry broke from them.</p>

<p>"She's got her!"</p>

<p>"'Tis Jenny! She was in there all the
time!"</p>

<p>"She's dead!"</p>

<p>"She's not; she's living, I see her move. Oh,
Mother of Mercy, they'll both be killed before
their own eyes!"</p>

<p>What was Grace doing? The form she held
in her arms was that of a slight girl of fifteen
or so. She was knotting something round her,
under arms and over breast; something half
sling, half rope; towels, perhaps, tied strongly
together. Now she brought the ends over her
own shoulders, bending forward.</p>

<p>"Now, Peggy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>With the unconscious child bound to her
back, Grace leaned out and grasped the rope;
another moment and she was swinging on it,
clinging with hands and feet, the old school way.</p>

<p>Margaret covered her face with her hand and
prayed. Peggy, steadying the rope with one
hand, held out the other, and waited.</p>

<p>Down, hand over hand! Slender hands, to
bear the double burden. Delicate shoulders,
to carry the dead weight that hangs on them.
Are they elastic steel, those fingers that grip
the rope, never slipping, never relaxing their
hold?</p>

<p>Down, hand over hand! the hands are bleeding
now; no matter! the white dress is black
with smoke, and blood drips on it here and
there; what of that? it is nearly over.</p>

<p>"Now?" Peggy asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>Steadying herself, Peggy left the rope, and
received the burden in her arms. Grace, holding
the rope with one hand, with the other
loosed the knot, and laid the limp arms over
Peggy's neck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right?" she said.</p>

<p>"All right!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ainsi long!</i>" and as Peggy carefully
slowly descended the ladder, Grace turned and
began quickly and steadily to climb the rope
again.</p>

<p>"Grace! Grace!" cried Margaret. "For
God's sake, what are you about? Come down!
There is no time to lose; come down!"</p>

<p>"And behold, all is vanity!" said Grace;
and she disappeared inside the burning house.</p>

<p>But Margaret could bear no more. She helped
to take the senseless girl from Peggy's arms
and lay her on the grass; then the world seemed
to slip from her, and she dropped quietly with
her head on Jenny's shoulder.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>JEWELS: AND AN AWAKENING</h3>


<p>"Are you better?" said Gerald. "Are you
truly better, Miss Margaret? I am going to
drown myself anyhow in the first bucket I find,
and if you don't feel better I shall make it a
dipper, and that would be so inconvenient, don't
you know?"</p>

<p>Margaret looked at him, only half hearing
what he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am better; I am very well, thank
you. What happened? Did I faint?"</p>

<p>"Yes! you fainted, just as we came up.
They wanted to pour water over you, but I
always think it's such a shame, in books,
to spoil their clothes, and you have such
pretty clothes. So I wouldn't let them. It
wasn't Peggy, it was a lot of fool cooks and
things."</p>

<p>"Did something hurt me?" asked Margaret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
vaguely, still feeling that she was somebody
else making friendly inquiries about herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, I&mdash;I pinched you, you dear, sweet,
pretty&mdash;at least, I don't mean that! at least
I do mean it, every word, only highly improper
under the circumstances, but I don't care so
long as you are better."</p>

<p>Making a strong effort, Margaret sat up and
looked about her. She was still on the Silverfield
lawn, but some one had drawn her away
from the neighborhood of the burning house,
now a shapeless mass, though still burning
fiercely, and had pillowed her head on a rolled-up
coat. Her companion was in his shirt-sleeves,
so it was evident whose coat it was.</p>

<p>As she gazed at the blazing ruins, memory
came back in a flood.</p>

<p>"Grace!" she cried, wildly. "Where is
Grace?"</p>

<p>"Safe," said Gerald, quickly. "Safe and
sound. Not a hair singed, though it sounds
impossible. Most astonishing person I ever
saw in my life. Came down the rope like a
foretopman, hung all over with jewels:
brooches, chains, and owches, you know,&mdash;Scripture,&mdash;kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of rope-walking Tiffany. You
never saw such a thing in your life. Hadn't
much more than touched the ground, when the
roof fell in. Standing luck of the British Army,
I call that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank God! thank God! but where is
she? where are they all?"</p>

<p>"Mostly gone to take the fainted girl home.
She didn't come to just right; choked with the
smoke, Hugh thought. Phil and Peggy are
carrying her, and Miss Wolfe giving moral
support. Hugh has gone for the nearest doctor.
The fool cooks have gone in search of
their wits, I suppose; they didn't seem to be
anywhere round here."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Jean? she was here too; is she all
right?"</p>

<p>Gerald hung his head. "She was left to
take care of you," he said. "I told her I was
a medical man, which is strictly untrue, and
asked her to go back to Fernley to get something,
cologne, or rum, or mustard,&mdash;I forget
what I did say. The women bothered and
made a noise, so I advised them to proceed
in the direction of Jericho. Great place, Jericho!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
They went&mdash;there or elsewhere. Don't get up
yet, please don't! it's always better to lie still
after a fire, or a faint; how much more after
both combined!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I must!" said Margaret. "I must go
home at once, Mr. Merryweather, truly. Oh,
thank you, but I can get up perfectly well&mdash;only
my head is queer still. I wish&mdash;why did
you send Jean away?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want her," said Gerald, meekly.
"You looked so pretty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't talk nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I'm not. It's my truthful nature. It
comes out in spots, like measles, in spite of me.
When I was only six years old, I told my
nurse she was a hideous old squunt, and she was.
Fact, or at least justifiable fiction. If you must
get up, won't you take poor Jerry's arm? just
once, before he drowns himself? it's your last
chance!"</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean? Why should you drown
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because I missed all the fun, and let you
faint, and Miss Wolfe get nearly burned up, and
Miss Peggy a sight to behold with smoke and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
water, and Hugh all tied up in t l k's, and all
for a day's yachting. Not that it wasn't great
yachting, but there is a sense of proportion."</p>

<p>"What are t l k's?" asked Margaret, smiling
faintly. She was recovering her composure,
and Gerald noted with inward thankfulness her
returning color. His running fire of nonsense,
kept up in the hope of rousing her to interest,
covered an anxious heart, but he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"T l k's? true lover's knots! none of my
business, of course, but the professor appears to
be interested in the fair acrobat&mdash;acrobatess&mdash;acrobatia&mdash;what
you will! Give you my
word, when he came round the corner and saw
her coming down that rope, I thought he would
curl up into knots himself. Jolly stunt! when
I first came I was awfully afraid&mdash;" Gerald
pulled himself up suddenly, and blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" said Margaret, innocently. "Afraid
of what?"</p>

<p>"Of bats! When they squeak, I desire to pass
away."</p>

<p>"Mr. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>"If you call me Mr. Merryweather any more,
I <i>shall</i> pass away, without benefit of buckets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Say Gerald! just try it, and see how pretty it
sounds. Gerald! 'tis a melting mouthful! Sentimental,
if you will, but what then?"</p>

<p>Margaret laughed in spite of herself. "I
must say, as Frances did, I never see such a
bold boy since born I was!" she said. "Well,
Gerald, then; and now, Gerald, here we are at
the house, and would you please go round the
north way, and not come into the library just
now? Thank you ever so much for helping me!
No, I must go in, I truly must."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Peyton was sitting bolt upright on the
sofa on which they had laid her. Her face was
absolutely colorless; it might have been an ivory
statue, but for the ghastly look of the blue eyes.
She fixed her eyes on Margaret, but said nothing.
Margaret ran to her, and put her arms
round her. "Oh, how could they leave you
alone?" she cried. "She is safe; every one is
safe, dear Mrs. Peyton. No one hurt, only
Jenny overcome with the smoke a little. I
thought Jean would have told you."</p>

<p>The ivory figure began to tremble. With
shaking hands she tried to put Margaret away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
from her; then, with a sudden revulsion of feeling,
she clung to her and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I sent them away!" she whispered through
her sobs. "I would not have them look at me.
Margaret&mdash;are you sure? that girl, is she truly
safe?"</p>

<p>"Truly and honestly, dear Mrs. Peyton. It
was a most marvellous escape, but she is absolutely
unharmed, and she saved another life
beside her own. But for Grace, poor little
Jenny must have been lost. She is a heroine,
our Grace!"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to kill her!" said the poor
woman. "I did not realize what it meant. I
said, 'My jewels! my jewels!' and I don't know
what other nonsense. She never said a word,
just turned and went back. Then&mdash;oh! then,
when you were all gone, I understood, I saw,
that I had sent her to her death for those&mdash;those
horrible things. Never&mdash;never let me see them
again! I have been sitting here&mdash;years, it
seems to me&mdash;waiting to hear that she was
dead; perhaps to see her body brought in, all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, hush, Mrs. Peyton! You will
make yourself ill. You are only distressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
yourself beyond all need. She is safe, I tell
you. In a few moments you will see for yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Grace
stood before them. She was a strange figure
indeed. Black with smoke, her fair hair gray
with ashes, her dress torn and discolored; but
sparkling with jewels as never was any ballroom
belle. Superb necklaces of diamond and emerald
hung around her neck; her arms glittered
with bracelets, her fingers were loaded with
rings, while ropes of amethyst and pearl were
wound around her head and even about her
waist.</p>

<p>"All the way over," said Grace, "I have been
pitying the robber who didn't meet me, and so
lost the great chance of his life. So sad for
him!"</p>

<p>Margaret recalled Gerald's expression, "a
rope-walking Tiffany," and could not help smiling
in spite of her anxiety; but Mrs. Peyton hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Take them away!" she said. "Take them
off, Grace! I never want to see them again.
Horrible things, all blood and flame! who knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
how many other lives they have cost? and it is
no fault of mine that they have not cost yours.
No fault of mine!"</p>

<p>This was so true, that neither Grace nor
Margaret spoke. Mrs. Peyton rose, and moved
restlessly about the room.</p>

<p>"Incidentally," she said, "I have got well."</p>

<p>Grace glanced at Margaret, but still neither
spoke. Mrs. Peyton gave Grace a strange look.
"You didn't set fire to the house deliberately,
I suppose?" she said.</p>

<p>"I did not!" said Grace, bluntly. "To be
honest, I have thought of it&mdash;thought, I mean,
of the effect it might produce; but it isn't a
thing one does in general society."</p>

<p>"I remember!" said Mrs. Peyton, dreamily.
"I remember. I did it myself."</p>

<p>"Did it yourself?" cried Margaret, aghast.
Grace was silent.</p>

<p>"I threw the candle down. I had been looking
in the glass, and I found a new wrinkle, a
horrible one. I threw the candle down, and it
fell on a roll of cotton wool. How it went! I
can hear the sound now, and see the fire run&mdash;run!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't talk about it any more," said
Grace, quietly.</p>

<p>"I must. I must tell it all. She&mdash;Grace,
there&mdash;found me; it had caught my bed, and
the curtains were blazing. She carried me out
of the room and down the stairs herself. What
is she made of? She isn't so tall as I. Then&mdash;at
the door&mdash;she set me down and told me
to run, and I ran. We ran together, till the
devil brought these things into my mind, and I
sent her back to be burned up for my vanity."</p>

<p>"I wasn't burned up," said Grace, composedly;
"and as you remarked just now, Mrs.
Peyton, you have got well. Do you want to
know what I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;that the game was worth the
candle!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>FOR AULD LANG SYNE</h3>


<p>"Confess that I have surprised you, John
Montfort!" said Mrs. Peyton.</p>

<p>"I do confess it, Emily," Mr. Montfort answered,
gravely. "But I am truly glad that my
house has been able to afford you shelter when
you were in need of it."</p>

<p>"That is as much as to say, that under other
circumstances&mdash;never mind! I am not going
to quarrel with you, John."</p>

<p>"I trust not," said Mr. Montfort, still speaking
with grave courtesy.</p>

<p>If Margaret had been present, she would have
wondered at the change in her uncle's face. The
warmth, the genial light of kindness, was clean
gone out of it; it was an older and a sterner
man who sat in the great armchair and looked
steadily and quietly at his visitor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton smiled, then frowned; at last she
sighed.</p>

<p>"I never meant to hurt you, John," she said,
softly. "Thirty years is a long time to hate a
person who&mdash;who never hated you."</p>

<p>"I have never hated you, Emily," said Mr.
Montfort, not unkindly. "Our paths have not
crossed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed. "No, they have not
crossed. You took care of that. They have
only run alongside each other&mdash;with the garden
wall between."</p>

<p>"And nothing else?" said John Montfort.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then, "I
never meant to make trouble between you and
Rose!"</p>

<p>"You never did," said Mr. Montfort, tranquilly.</p>

<p>"I know! but&mdash;you thought I tried. I did
tell you a lie that night, when I said she would
not see you. How could I know that she was
going to die before you came back from the
West? I&mdash;I wanted to see you myself; that
was no such dreadful sin, was it? I was sorry&mdash;sorry,
I tell you, when I heard of her death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Thirty years ago, and I have never been able
to speak to you alone till to-day. I&mdash;I had to
burn my house down to get a chance to make
my peace with you, John Montfort. No, I don't
mean that I did it on purpose, though I am not
sure that it wouldn't&mdash;aren't you going to forgive
me, John, after all these years?"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort rose. He was very pale, but he
spoke steadily. "Emily, it is hardly strange
that I do not care to open old wounds. If I
have been unkind, I am sorry for it. I do forgive
you, fully and freely. Now, let the past
alone. What can I do for you in the present,
and how help you to provide for the future? I
have not been a good neighbor, I confess it;
I will try to prove myself a better one henceforward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed her little mocking laugh.
"It will be easier than you think, John. I am
going to Europe, and I don't know whether I
shall ever come back."</p>

<p>"Going to Europe, Emily? Are you strong
enough?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well!" said Mrs. Peyton,
simply. "Doctor Flower has been telling me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for several years that there was nothing really
the matter with me any more, and that I could
be well if I wanted. Grace Wolfe made me
feel the same thing. Well, now I do want it.
The fire lighted up a good many things for me,
and showed me the way. I have no house to
live in; I am alone in the world; I may as well
be doing things as staying in bed, of which I
am really very tired. I am writing to my man
of business to take places for Antonia and me
on next week's steamer for Paris. I've half a
mind to take Grace Wolfe, too, if she will go."</p>

<p>"I have asked Grace to make her home with
us for the present," said Mr. Montfort, quickly.
"Next year I expect to take her and Margaret
abroad together."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed again. "I can't even
have her! Well&mdash;never mind. I love her,
but she frightens me. She might have catalepsy
again,&mdash;though I rather think that was
a clever device for getting me out of bed,&mdash;and
I want to forget everything connected with
sickness. But&mdash;John&mdash;there is something you
can do for me. This girl risked her life to save
my jewels, the playthings I have tried to amuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
myself with these many years. I want you to
sell them for me, and give her the money."</p>

<p>"Sell your jewels, Emily!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I never want to see them again."
She shuddered slightly, but her voice was firm
and steady.</p>

<p>"They are all here, in this basket. Lock
them up now, and the next time you go to
town sell them, and invest the money for Grace
Wolfe. Will you do this for me, John? It is
the only thing I shall ever be likely to ask you."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, Emily!" said Mr. Montfort,
speaking with much more warmth than he had
hitherto shown. "It will be a grateful commission.
Shall I look?&mdash;these things are of great
value, Emily. There are thousands of dollars'
worth of trump&mdash;of trinkets here."</p>

<p>"So much the better for Grace!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing you would like to keep?
None of these diamonds?"</p>

<p>"No; I detest diamonds! When a complexion
begins to go&mdash;never mind! Stay, though!
Margaret liked that pink pearl; sweet little
prim Margaret, who has given me most of the
little pleasure I have had these last three years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
You'll let her have it, John? I beg you to let
me give it to her!"</p>

<p>"Surely, surely, my dear Emily. It is a
beautiful gem, and I am glad that my Margaret
should have something to remember you by
while you are gone. And now shake hands, for
I must be off."</p>

<p>"You are going away?"</p>

<p>"For the night only. I was to have spent
two or three days in town on business, but
hurried home on hearing of the fire. I shall
be back to-morrow, or next day at latest."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I may stay here till then, John?"</p>

<p>"My dear Emily, I earnestly beg that you
will stay as long as it is convenient to you.
You must have many things to arrange; pray
consider Fernley as your own house until you
have everything comfortably settled."</p>

<p>"Thank you, John! I heard your own voice
then, the kindest voice that&mdash;good-by, John
Montfort!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Gone, you say, Margaret? When did she
go? I fully expected to see her again."</p>

<p>"This afternoon, Uncle John. We could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
persuade her to stay longer. Her man of business
came down this morning early, and arranged
everything with the farmer and the servants,
and finally took her and Antonia back with him.
It is very sudden! I should be frightened at
her attempting the voyage, but Grace says it
is just what Doctor Flower has been wishing
and hoping for. Poor Mrs. Peyton! I shall
miss her very much, Uncle John. She is very,
very lovable; and, somehow, these few days
have so softened and changed her&mdash;I hardly
know how to put it, but it is as if her heart
had waked up after a long sleep."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it has!" said Mr. Montfort, thoughtfully.
"Poor Emily! she has had an unhappy
life; yet when she was your age, Margaret,
Emily Silverton thought she had the world at
her feet. Life is instructive, my child. Did
she tell you what she had done about
Grace?"</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head. "She said you
would have something to tell me, but she would
not say anything more. She was bent on keeping
control over her nerves, I think, so I tried
just to keep things quiet and cheerful, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
saw that was what she wanted. What is it
about Grace?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Montfort told the story of
the jewels, and how he had taken them to town
with him the day before. "It will be a great
change for our Grace," he said. "She has
had very little money, I think you told me,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, almost none, Uncle John. She has had
a very, very hard time; and since her father
died last year&mdash;she seems to have no other
relations&mdash;she has supported herself entirely.
Oh, this is a kind thing of Mrs. Peyton; and
I understand just how she feels and why she
wants to do it. Aren't the jewels worth a good
deal, Uncle John?"</p>

<p>"Guess how much, little girl!"</p>

<p>"How can I? Perhaps as much as a thousand
dollars? Oh, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Margaret; my child, Tiffany's head
man thinks,&mdash;he could not price them all exactly,&mdash;but,
roughly speaking, he thinks&mdash;that
this collection is worth&mdash;fifty thousand dollars.
Grace is, comparatively speaking, a rich woman."</p>

<p>Margaret stood speechless, in utter amazement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
At this moment there was a sound, as
of a book falling to the ground, and a smothered
exclamation. Both started and looked round,
as Hugh Montfort rose from the corner where
he had been seated and came slowly forward.
He was very pale, and seemed to bear more
heavily on his stick than usual.</p>

<p>"You knew I was here, Margaret?" he said,
with a look that tried to be unconcerned. "I
trust I have not overheard anything that I
should not. I was writing, and thought you
saw me when you came in."</p>

<p>"No secrets, my boy, no secrets!" said Mr.
Montfort, heartily. "You heard this great
piece of news about our little friend, did you?
She does not know it herself yet; Margaret
must tell her. Margaret, you have deserved
this pleasure, my dear, and I rejoice in making
it over to you."</p>

<p>The good man was glowing with pleasure and
good will; but for once he met no response
from Hugh, who, pale and gloomy, stared before
him as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," cried Mr. Montfort, changing
his tone at once, "you are not well. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pale you are! or&mdash;you have had no bad news,
Hugh? Nobody ill at home, eh? Your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, sir, all well! Father is in perfect
trim; I have just been reading a letter from
him, Uncle John; you must hear it, sometime
when you are not busy. Don't look at me like
that, Margaret! I&mdash;my head aches a little, if
I must confess. Did you never see any one with
a headache before?"</p>

<p>Was it possible that Hugh was out of temper?
Neither Mr. Montfort nor Margaret could believe
it at first; both gazed at him, expecting the
usual kindly smile to begin in his eyes and
break gradually over his face; but no smile
came. Mr. Montfort, who had lived many
years and seen many things, was the first to
recover himself; he passed Hugh with a friendly
pat on the shoulder, and, nodding to Margaret,
went out of the room. Margaret remained still,
looking earnestly in her cousin's face, unconscious
of offence.</p>

<p>"Dear Hugh," she said, affectionately, "I am
so sorry! Let me get you something&mdash;one of
those tablets that relieved you last time."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Hugh. "It is nothing, Margaret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
nothing at all. So Miss Wolfe is a rich
woman, is she, and spoilt for life? And you
are glad, you and Uncle John! Well, I am
sorry, for my part; sorry from the bottom of
my heart. It is an iniquity."</p>

<p>"Hugh!"</p>

<p>"It is! She will grow into an idle fine lady,
like this very Mrs. Peyton, who throws about
her gewgaws at every whim. Her life will be
frittered away over dresses and frippery and
fashion. Instead of a worker, a real woman,
with a woman's work and aims, you will have
a butterfly, pretty and useless, fluttering about
in the sunshine, unable to bear rough weather.
A fine piece of work it will be, the ruining of a
girl like that."</p>

<p>Margaret stood aghast, and for a few moments
found no words. Her cousin's face
showed that he was only too deeply in earnest;
his eyes glowed with sombre fire, and a
dark red spot burned in his cheek. When Margaret
did speak at last, her eyes were tender,
but her voice was grave, almost stern. "Hugh,"
she said, "I hardly know you; and I see that
you do not know Grace in the least. I thought&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
thought you did&mdash;understand her, better
perhaps than any one else did; but if you can
say such things as these, I see I was utterly mistaken.
She, spoiled by a little prosperity? Oh,
how can you? For shame, Hugh!"</p>

<p>Hugh looked up at her suddenly. "Oh, Margaret!"
he said. "Margaret, have patience with
me! I&mdash;I am not myself to-day. My head&mdash;there
is something wrong with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Margaret, tenderly. "Go
and lie down, Hugh, won't you? And I'll bring
you some cracked ice. That always helps a
little."</p>

<p>"I don't want to lie down, and I don't want
any cracked ice; thank you all the same, good
little sister-cousin! I'll go out into the garden,
I think. The trees will be the best thing for
me to-day. And&mdash;Margaret&mdash;forget what I
said, will you? It is none of my business, of
course; only&mdash;good-by, little girl!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>IN THE GARDEN</h3>


<p>"But, Grace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But-ter, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"My dear, please don't be absurd!"</p>

<p>"My angel, I am not half so absurd as you
are. Why, in the name of all that is incongruous,
should I take this lady's money? Is thy
servant a dog, that she should do this thing?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Grace! You are wholly, utterly
wrong. Listen to me! Let us sit down here
by the summer-house and have it out. No, you
have said enough; it is my turn now. You talk
about yourself, and your independence and freedom,
and I don't know what. My dear, I want
you to forget yourself, and think of her."</p>

<p>"Of her? What difference does it make to
her?"</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world, it may be.
What is that noise?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is I!" said Hugh, emerging from the summer-house.
"I seem fated to be an eavesdropper,
and yet I am not one by nature. Pardon me,
young ladies!"</p>

<p>He was about to pass them with a formal bow,
but Margaret, with a sudden inspiration, caught
his arm. "No!" she cried, "I want you to hear
what I am going to say. You, too, misunderstand&mdash;sit
down, Hugh, and listen! Please!"
she added, in the tone that seldom failed to win
any heart.</p>

<p>Hugh hesitated, but finally sat down, looking
very grim, and stared at the box-tree in front
of him. Margaret went on, hurriedly, moved
for once out of her gentle calm.</p>

<p>"This lady&mdash;I must speak plainly, though
she is my friend&mdash;has lived a selfish, empty,
idle life. She was very beautiful and very rich,
really one of the great beauties and heiresses,
and&mdash;and that was all. She was brought up
by a worldly aunt&mdash;her mother died when she
was little&mdash;and married to some one whom she
cannot have cared for very much, I am afraid;
and she never had any children. Then came
all this ill health. Oh, Grace, I can't help it if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
it wasn't all real, she certainly has suffered a
great deal; and through it all she has been
alone, loving no one, and with no one to love
her. She will not see any of her own people,
cousins&mdash;she has no one nearer; she says they
are all mercenary. I don't know, of course,
but it is one of the terrible things about having
a great deal of money, that you think everybody
wants it, whether they do or not. Now, at last,
before it was too late,&mdash;oh, I am so thankful
for that,&mdash;the change has come. She has waked
up, and it is all owing to you, Grace. Yes, it
is! I have been fond of her, and she has petted
me, and been very good to me, and given me
things, but I never could open her eyes, try as
I would. Now, you have done it, dear. You
not only saved her life actually&mdash;yes, you did,
Grace; she told me all about it; she never
would have got out of that room alive but for
you&mdash;you not only saved her life, but you have
given her some idea of how to live. She wants
to do something in return. It is the first time,
I do believe, that she has wanted <i>really</i> to help
some one else. When she gave me prettinesses,
it was because it amused her to do it, not because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
I needed them, nor because she was thinking
specially about me.</p>

<p>"Grace, if you refuse this; if you shut back
the kindly impulse, the desire to help some one,
I tell you you will be doing a wrong thing. It
is nothing in the world but pride, selfish pride,
that is speaking in you. Tell me again&mdash;tell
Hugh, what Mrs. Peyton said to you when she
went away."</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;" Grace's voice had not its usual
cool evenness, but was husky, and faltered now
and then&mdash;"she said, 'Do not refuse my last
wish! I do not tell you what it is, for fear you
should refuse at once, and shut me up with
myself again. Do not refuse, for the sake of
Christian kindness, of which I have known
nothing hitherto, but which I mean to learn
something about if I can.'"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;she kissed me&mdash;Margaret, it is
brutal of you to make me tell this!&mdash;she kissed
me twice, and said&mdash;" Grace's voice broke. "I&mdash;cannot!"
she faltered.</p>

<p>Margaret rose to her feet with a sudden impulse.
"Hark!" she said. "Is that Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
John calling me? Wait here, please, both of
you!" and she ran off, never looking behind
her. It was the first and last deceitful act of
Margaret Montfort's life.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Hugh Montfort
stared at the box-tree. Grace cried a little,
quietly; then wiped away her tears, not
noticing them much, and observed an ant
running along the path. At last, "Well?"
said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Grace. "I am sorry to have
made such a spectacle of myself. Is there
anything to say?"</p>

<p>Hugh plucked a box-leaf and scrutinized it
carefully.</p>

<p>"They make these things so even!" he said.</p>

<p>"Machinery never could&mdash;Let me tell you a
story. Do you mind? Once upon a time there
was a man&mdash;or&mdash;well, call him a man! He
was part of one, anyhow, as much as accident
allowed. He was not strong, but he could work,
and he meant to work, and do things he cared
about, and lead as good a life as he knew how.
He had been a good deal alone, somehow, though
he had dear good people of his own; he was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
odd stick, I suppose, as odd as the one he walked
with."</p>

<p>He stopped, glanced at his stick, with its
handle worn smooth as glass; then he went
on.</p>

<p>"He had never seen much of women, except
his own family; never thought about them
much as individuals, though always in his mind
there was a dream&mdash;I suppose all men have it&mdash;of
some one he should meet some day, who
would turn the world from gray to gold. One
day&mdash;he saw a vision; and&mdash;after that&mdash;he
learned, not all at once, but little by little, that
life was not full and rounded, as he had thought
it, but empty and one-sided and unprofitable, if
this vision could not be always before his eyes;
if this one woman could not come into his life,
to be his star, his light, his joy and happiness.
She was poor, like himself. He thought of
working for her, of sharing with her the honest,
laborious, perhaps helpful life he had planned,
the life of a Western forester, living among the
woods and mountains, studying the trees he
loved, learning the secrets of nature at first
hand, teaching his beloved all the little he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
knew, and learning more, a thousandfold more,
from every look of her eyes, every tone of her
wonderful voice.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;while he dreamed&mdash;something happened.
Suddenly, by a wave of a wand, as in
the fairy tales, his maiden was transformed.
Instead of the orphan girl, working bravely
with her brave hands to earn her bread, he saw&mdash;a
rich woman! saw the woman he loved condemned
by the idle whim of an idle pleasure-seeker
to sit with folded hands, or play with
toys and trinkets. He was filled with rage; he
hated the very sound of the word money, because&mdash;it
seemed to him that this money would
rob him of his darling. I&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hugh broke off suddenly. "I am the greatest
fool in the world!" he said. "Grace, do you
understand me? Do you know what I am trying
to say?"</p>

<p>It was the merest whisper that replied, "I
don't&mdash;know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do." Hugh caught the slender
hands, and held them close. "You know, you
must know, that I have cared for you ever since
that first wonderful moment, when you broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
through the leaves like sunshine, and I saw the
face I had dreamed of all my life. You must
have felt it, all these weeks. Oh, Margaret is
right, I suppose. All she says is true enough;
if you can help this poor woman by taking her
wretched money, I suppose you will have to do
it. But&mdash;but I lose my princess, before ever
I could win her. I can't ask a rich woman to
be my wife."</p>

<p>While Hugh was speaking, Grace's head had
drooped lower and lower, as if she shrank under
the weight that was laid upon her; but now
she looked up bravely, with a lovely light in
her eyes. "Can't you, Hugh?" she said. "It's
a pity you can't, Hugh, because&mdash;you could
have her for the asking."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>UNCLE JOHN'S BIRTHDAY</h3>


<p>If Timothy Bannan has had scant mention
in these pages, it is not because he was not an
important personage at Fernley. King of the
stable, governor of the dogs, chief authority on
all matters pertaining to what Gerald called
"four-leggers," he was as much a part of the
establishment as Frances herself. In person he
was a small man, with reddish-gray whiskers,
an obstinate chin, and a kindly twinkling eye.
He usually wore a red waistcoat with black
sleeves, and he was suspected of matrimonial
designs on Elizabeth.</p>

<p>One morning, not long after the events of
which I have been telling, Bannan approached
his master, who was tying up roses, Margaret,
as usual, attending him with shears and ball of
twine.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Bannan, touching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
his hat, "would it be convenient for me to take
a horse this evening, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort straightened himself, and looked
with friendly interest at his retainer.</p>

<p>"A horse, Bannan? Certainly! What horse
do you want?"</p>

<p>Bannan looked embarrassed. "I was thinking
of taking Chief, if you was anyways willing,
sir." Now Chief was the pride of the Fernley
stable. Mr. Montfort opened his eyes a little.</p>

<p>"Going far, Bannan?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;not so very far, sir. I was wishful to
try him with the new cart, if you had no objections."</p>

<p>The new cart was a particularly stylish and
comfortable wagonette, bought for Margaret to
take her young friends out in, and Mr. Montfort's
eyes opened still wider.</p>

<p>"Well, Bannan&mdash;of course you will be careful.
You want to take some friends out, eh?"</p>

<p>This simple question seemed to embarrass
Bannan strangely. He reddened, and taking
off his cap, turned it round and round in his
hands. "No, sir, I shouldn't presume&mdash;that
is to say, not exactly friends, sir, and yet not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
anyways the reverse. But if it's not agreeable
to you, sir, I'll take the old mare and the
Concord wagon."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. Montfort, kindly. "Take
Chief and the cart by all means, Bannan. I
wish you a pleasant drive with your&mdash;friends."
Bannan thanked him and withdrew, and Mr.
Montfort turned to Margaret with a smile and
a sigh. "Does that mean Elizabeth and matrimony,
Margaret? What will Frances say?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Uncle, I am quite sure that Elizabeth
would disapprove as much as Frances of
Bannan's taking Chief and the wagonette. You
are too indulgent, dear sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," said Mr. Montfort. "I
suppose, also, that I am too old to change. But
I never knew Bannan to do such a thing
before."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bannan was standing at the
kitchen door, fuming. "If ever I do sich a
thing again, Frances, you may cut me up and
serve me in a gravy-boat."</p>

<p>"Nobody'd touch ye!" said Frances. "Ye've
got to have juice to make gravy, ye little bones-bag.
I told ye let me see to it; men-folks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
always messes when they try to manage nice
things. It's like as if you started to whip cream
with a garding hose."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" said Bannan. "'Twas me
the telegram come to, and 'twas me they expected
to see to it. You'd like to boss everything
and everybody on the place, Frances."</p>

<p>"I'll boss you with this mop, little man, if
you give me any sauce," said Frances, with
massive calm. "Go away now and feed your
beasts; it's what you're best at."</p>

<p>"But you'll have the supper ready and all,
Frances? If I can feed beasts, you can feed
their masters, I'm bound to own that," said
Bannan, presenting this transparent sop with
an air of hopeful diffidence.</p>

<p>"Go 'long with ye!" said Frances, loftily,
yet with a suggestion of softening in her voice.
"I've kep' Mr. John's birthday for twenty
years, but I reckon you'd better tell me how to
do it this time."</p>

<p>"And you'll tell nobody about&mdash;them&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Frances raised the mop with such a
businesslike air that Bannan took himself off,
grumbling and shaking his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Left alone, Frances fell into a frenzy of preparation,
and when Margaret found her half an
hour later, she was beating eggs, stoning raisins,
and creaming butter, apparently all at the same
moment. An ardent consultation followed.
What flavor would Mr. John (Frances would
never say Mr. Montfort) like best for the ice-cream?
and the cake&mdash;would a caramel frosting
be best, or a boiled frosting with candied fruits
chopped into it? and for the small cakes, now,
and the tartlets?</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort's birthday came, as most birthdays
do, once a year. Considering this, it was
a singular thing that he, the most methodical
of men, who turned his calendar as regularly as
he wound his watch, never seemed to remember
it. He never failed to be astonished at Margaret's
morning greeting. More than this, he
apparently forgot it as soon as it was over, for
he always had a fresh stock of astonishment on
hand for the health-imperilling feast that Frances
was sure to arrange for the evening. To-day
he took no notice of the fact that wherever he
went he came upon some girl or boy carrying
armfuls of flowers and ferns, or arranging them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in bowls, jars, and vases. When he found his
desk heaped with a tangle of clematis and wild
lilies,&mdash;Peggy had dropped them there "just for
a minute," half an hour before,&mdash;this excellent
man merely said "Charming," and rescued his
pet Montaigne from the wet sprays which covered
it. In the course of the morning, Fernley
House was transformed into a bower of greenery,
lit up with masses of splendid color. Everywhere
drooped or nodded clusters of ferns, the ostrich
fern and the great Osmunda Regalis, with here
and there masses of maiden-hair, most delicate
and beautiful of all. In the library, especially,
the ferns were arranged with all the skill and
care that Margaret possessed. They outlined
the oaken shelves, their delicate tracery seeming
to lie lovingly against the rich mellow tints of
morocco and vellum; they waved from tall
vases of crystal and porcelain; they spread
their lace-like fronds in flat bowls and dishes.
"I don't see how there can be any left," said
Peggy; "it seems as if we had all the ferns in
the world, and yet in the woods it didn't seem
to make any difference. Oh, Jean, isn't it just
splendid!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corking!" said Jean.</p>

<p>"Jean, I won't have you say that."</p>

<p>"Well, the Merryweathers say it all the time,
Peggy. They never say anything else, except
when Margaret is round; you know they don't."</p>

<p>"The Merryweathers are boys, and you are a
girl, and there is all the difference in the world,"
said Peggy, loftily. "Jean, it is high time you
went to school."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother school! I have two ponies to
break this fall, and Pa has promised to let me
drive the reaper around the hundred-acre
field."</p>

<p>Peggy said nothing, being a wise as well as
an affectionate elder sister; but she resolved to
consult Hugh, and to write to "Pa" without
delay.</p>

<p>So the morning passed in preparation and
mystery. Then in the afternoon came a drive
in the great open car, a delightful vehicle, holding
eight people comfortably. Peggy sat on the
box&mdash;happy Peggy!&mdash;and drove the spirited
black horses. Uncle John was by her side, and
they recalled merrily the day when, as John
Strong, he took his first drive with her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
decided that she was to be trusted with a
horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun we did have that summer!"
cried Peggy. "Only&mdash;we had no Uncle John.
Oh, Uncle, if we had Rita here, wouldn't it be
too absolutely perfect for anything?"</p>

<p>"It would be very delightful," said Mr.
Montfort. "I would give a good deal to see
that dark-eyed lassie and her gallant Jack.
I think I must take you and Margaret to Cuba
one of these days, Peggy, to see them. How
would you like that, Missy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John!" cried Peggy; and she
almost dropped the whip, in the effort to
squeeze his arm and turn a corner at the
same moment.</p>

<p>But the best of all was when the whole
family assembled in the library before supper,
the girls in their very prettiest dresses, with
flowers in their hair, the lads brave in white
duck waistcoats, with roses and ferns in their
buttonholes. Then the girls presented the
gifts they had made for the beloved uncle;
Margaret's book, a fine old copy of the "Colloquies
of Erasmus," bound by her own hands in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
gold-stamped brown leather, Peggy's mermaid-penwiper,
with a long tail of sea-green sewing
silk, and the pincushion on which Jean had
spent many painful hours in her efforts to make
the ferns look like ferns instead of like green
hen feathers. Grace had woven a basket of
sweet rushes, of quaint and graceful pattern,
which Mr. Montfort <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'delared'">declared</ins> was what he had
dreamed of all his life, while Hugh produced
a box of wonderful cigars, which had a history
as mysterious and subtle as their fragrance.
Lastly, the Merryweathers, declaring
that they had no gift but themselves, and
that if Mr. Montfort would be graciously
pleased to accept them, they were his, proceeded
to go through a series of acrobatic performances,
which brought cries of admiration from
all the beholders.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Margaret took
advantage of the interlude (though she was
loth to lose one of Gerald's graceful postures)
to run out and see if supper was ready. She
came back with a rueful countenance, and
whispered to Peggy, "Supper will not be ready
for ten minutes yet, and Frances is in a most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
frightful temper. She actually drove me out
of the kitchen; said she would not be bothered
with foolish children, and she would not send
supper in till Bannan came back, if it cost her
her place."</p>

<p>"Bannan? What has Bannan to do with
supper?"</p>

<p>"Bringing something, I suppose; some extra
frill she has prepared as a surprise. She is
always savage when she has a surprise on foot.
Hark! There are wheels now. Listen! Yes,
they are going round to the back door. Bannan
has come, then, and we may hope for food.
Oh, do look at those boys! Did you ever see
anything like that?"</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed on the twins, who,
after every variety of separate antic, now proceeded
to perform what they called a patent
reversible waltz. Standing on their hands, they
twined their feet together in the air, and revolved
gracefully, moving in unison, and keeping
time to the waltz they whistled. The whole
company was watching this proceeding with
such absorbed attention that no one saw the
door at the back of the hall open silently; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
one noticed the figure that stole noiselessly
through, and now stood motionless in the doorway.
A young woman, slender, richly dressed,
beautiful exceedingly; with a certain foreign
grace, which struck the eye even more than her
beauty. But it was neither the grace nor the
beauty that was first to be seen now; it was
the light of love in the large dark eyes, the soft
fire of joy and tenderness and mirth that shone
from them, and seemed to irradiate her whole
figure as she stood there, erect, yet seeming to
sway forward, her hand on the door, her eyes
bent on the group before her. Her gaze wandered
for a moment to the guests: the revolving
boys, Grace and Hugh in their quiet corner
together, Jean staring with open eyes and
mouth; but after a wondering look, it came
back and settled again on the central group,
Mr. Montfort, in his great armchair, Peggy and
Margaret each on a stool beside him, leaning
against his knees. Was the group complete?
or was there room for another by that good
man's side?</p>

<p>Jean was the first to look up and see the
newcomer. She started violently. "My goodness!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
she cried, "who is that?" The next
instant a cry rang out, as Margaret and Peggy
sprang forward, "Rita! Rita!"</p>

<p>But Rita was too quick for them. Before
they were well on their feet she had them both
in her arms, and was weeping, sobbing, laughing,
and kissing, all in a breath. With the
next breath she had sunk at Mr. Montfort's feet,
and, seizing his hand, pressed it passionately to
her lips.</p>

<p>"My dear child," cried Uncle John, blushing
like a girl, and drawing away his hand in great
discomposure. "Don't, my love; pray don't.
Rita! is it possible that this is really you?
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"What does it mean, my uncle? It means
that even in Cuba we know the days of the
month. Dearest and best of men, I wish you
a thousand returns of the day,&mdash;five, ten
thousand returns, and each one more blissful
than the last. Marguerite, my angel, you are
more beautiful than ever. Angel is no longer
the word; you are a seraph! Embrace me
again! Peggy, you are a mountain; but a
veritable mountain of roses and cream! Dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
little huge creature, I adore you. But where,
then, is the rest of me? Jack! Figure to
yourself a husband who skulks in doorways at
a moment like this! Come forth, thou!"</p>

<p>Jack Del Monte advanced laughing; behind
him in the passage the three conspirators,
Frances, Elizabeth, and Bannan, peered triumphant.
"My dear," said Jack, "I was
merely waiting for my cue. You would not
have had me spoil your entrance, you know you
would not. Uncle John&mdash;I may say Uncle
John? thanks!&mdash;I hope you will forgive Rita's
little stratagem for the sake of the pleasure it
has given her."</p>

<p>"My dear nephew," said Uncle John, "you
have brought me the most enchanting birthday
gift that ever a man had. Let me look at you
again, Rita! If ever happiness agreed with a
person&mdash;but I must not begin upon compliments
now. I want you to know these cousins
and friends. Here is Hugh Montfort and Jean;
here is Grace Wolfe, who is to be your cousin
one of these good days; and here are our friends
Gerald and Philip Merryweather. You have all
heard of one another; let us all be friends at
once, without further ceremony, and keep this
joyful feast together."</p>

<p>"Supper is served, sir," said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>A joyful feast it was indeed. The table,
decked with ferns and roses, was covered with
every good thing that Frances could think of,
and she could think of a good many. The
candles shed their cheerful light on all, though
the faces hardly needed the artificial light.
Amid general mirth, Rita told of her plan;
her letter of inquiry to Frances and Elizabeth,
asking if all were well, and if their coming
would make any inconvenience. Then the
telegram to Bannan, and the arrival, to find
him awaiting them with the best horse the
stable afforded; and, finally, their stealthy
entrance at the back door. All had been triumphantly
successful, and as Rita told her
story, she laughed and clapped her hands with
the glee of a child, while every face glowed
responsive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"And now," said Rita Del Monte, springing
to her feet, and lifting high her glass, "I wish
to propose a toast&mdash;the only fitting toast for
this night. I propose, dear friends, and dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
strangers whom I hope to have for friends, the
health of the best man&mdash;ah, Jack, you have
not had time yet, nor you others; but courage,
time is before you!&mdash;of the best man, I say,
that lives upon this earth to-day; the dearest,
the kindest&mdash;oh, all please drink to the health
of my Uncle John!"</p>

<p>One and all were upon their feet; all bending
forward, glass in hand, eager and joyous, their
eyes shining with love and admiration; and
from one and all came the same glad cry,
"Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Because if one hasn't the luck to be really
his nephew," said Gerald, "the least one can
do is to make a bluff at it."</p>

<p>And here, at this happy moment, let us leave
our friends. Good-by, Margaret&mdash;dear Margaret!
Good-by, Peggy and Rita, Hugh and
Grace, Gerald and Phil,&mdash;we may see you again,
boys,&mdash;Jean and Jack! Good-by, and good
luck to you! Last of all, good-by to you, John
Montfort. If you are not the best man in the
world, you are at least a good one! Wise and
strong, courteous and kindly, brave and true,
long may you live, as now you sit, in your own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
beautiful home, surrounded by those you love
best in the world. Love, kindness, and truth;
having these, what more do you lack? Good-by,
John Montfort.</p>
